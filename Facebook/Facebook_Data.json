                " My name is Anthony Simpson, retired Law enforcement officer and retired Air Force veteran writing from Texas. I am attempting to get some information on who to contact for assistance. My son who\u2019s name is Anthony Jevon Simpson who currently resides in Portage Wisconsin who suffers from depression called for assistance to 911 in the early afternoon on Friday 12/13/2019. The police arrived at about two am Saturday morning. They did not read him Miranda rights and arrested him charging him with domestic violence and false imprisonment of a cellphone. That is correct a cell phone that he took from his wife. Which they are stating is a felony. He was denied water for 24 hours and he was denied medical attention that he originally asked for. My son is African American and his wife is white.  When we spoke to his wife she stated they had an argument and my son is the one who called 911 for assistance because he said he was feeling suicidal. The arresting officer told him he will be released real soon 3-4 times. They held him for three days being not offered an appointed attorney either by the state or his own is a violation of his rights.  They are suppose to release him on Monday morning to appear in court on Tuesday for ridiculous accusations that never happened. If you could assist me to someone to help with this issue I would appreciate it.",

There was little movement among the rubbish, soiled mattresses and crushed beer cans. Only the dogs and the occasional toss and turn among a pile of blankets hoarded together to protect them from the night air.",

It mattered not as there was no sense of priority in place to differentiate the importance of any want or need, just a varying tone that dissipated into the cold morning air."

                " ",
                " As usual, the path to \u201csuccess\u201d was paved with good intentions. In the sixties, the group of local liberals came up with the ridiculous idea that if Negro families were given a large child allowance, then they, freed from sinful thoughts about earning money, would devote themselves to raising a child and raising a lot of cultured, educated blacks.",
                " However, for some reason, black women chose to free themselves from their husbands so that they would not claim a share of the child allowance and would not interfere with giving birth and lounging. Since the seventies in the USA, the number of black children born out of wedlock has sharply begun to grow: today it is about 80%.",
                " ",
                " Social and statistical studies clearly indicate the fact that children born in single-parent families lag behind peers in mental health and overall success.",
                " For children born in black ghettos, this lag becomes catastrophic.",
                " The main reason is that for black women from the ghetto, the birth and nurturing of children becomes a banal source of income. By themselves, the children are of little interest to them, as long as they are alive and pay allowance for them. Often black women begin to engage in this \u201cbusiness\u201d as early as fifteen to sixteen. Already in the third generation, those raised in such a family create a society that does not differ from the society of herds of monkeys.",
                " ",
                " As you know, human intelligence is laid in early childhood, at the age of three to six years. And it largely depends on \u201chow many fairy tales were read to the child\u201d, how much attention was spent on its development, what emphasis was placed on the education of the baby.",
                " ",
                " Given that about half of the blacks from the ghetto are functionally illiterate - this term means the inability to read and comprehend the text more complicated than the label of a beer bottle, it can reasonably be assumed that black children were not read tales. And then the \u201cMowgli effect\u201d takes effect. In the absence of normal upbringing and education in early childhood, no subsequent efforts will allow to give a person a normal education and increase his level of intelligence.",
                " ",
                " American black biomass not only has no desire to learn, ghetto-niggas are simply not able to learn. In the USA, they no longer even try to educate them - this is replaced by profanity, imitation of study and mantras about \u201cethnic culture\u201d.",
                " ",
                " At the same time, black biomass has a clear understanding that \u201cthey all owe them\u201d because \u201ctheir ancestors suffered\u201d. In the eighties, blacks rebelled because they demanded to give them work. How many ghetto niggas today need to give them a job? No one.",
                " ",
                " Can this problem be solved? If, for example, the entire white population of the United States will wash the feet of all blacks - will this improve something? Obviously not. And even if the entire white population is put into slavery for blacks for ten years, this will only worsen and aggravate the problem.",
                " ",
                " As long as the ghetto subculture exists in the United States, the \u201cmost advanced democracy\u201d will fully grasp the black issue. Judging by the population pyramids, the number of white children drops sharply, and the number of black children increases. This will lead to a gradual further change in the ratio of the proportion of white and black. Based on the level of black unemployment, it is the number of ghetto-niggas that is growing. As a result, all the problems existing today will only grow.",
                " ",
                " Already, the US authorities are forced to direct a significant part of the colonial income to the satisfaction of the Negro population. This year, against the backdrop of the fight against the \u201cpandemic\u201d, they were forced to significantly increase unemployment benefits, benefits and other distributions of \u201ccarrots\u201d.",
                " Try to take them now. Objective - due to lack of resources or subjective - due to the redistribution of resources, a decrease in the living standards of blacks will lead to a bacchanal of robbery and violence, compared with which the current \u201cshoe polish revolution\u201d seems like a rehearsal of a children's matinee."

I witnessed a caged police bus transporting children into a repurposed factory where they will be kept. These children were ripped from their mothers and in a foreign land with nothing and no one. I could see those kids crying. The children were to afraid to move. The younger ones made tiny waves back at us and put their hands against the windows while we chanted that they were not alone in Spanish. Once we knew the children were on the bus we flooded the street and stopped the bus from moving. We stood on all sides of the bus. We signed ",

In this picture Imam Omar Suleiman is placing his hand on a child's hand and praying. If you look closely you can see tiny hands pressed against the tinted windows. I was not prepared to witness any of this. My tears didn't stop from the moment we realized what was on that bus. I hope those beautiful babies knew we would do anything to give them their family and their freedom. I hope they know we love them. I hope this fuels my heart to do more. I have more to write but I can't see through my tears. ",

Convinced that white supremacy and the institution of slavery were threatened by the November 1860 election of Republican candidate Abraham Lincoln to the U.S. presidency on a platform which opposed the expansion of slavery into the western territories, the Confederacy declared its secession in rebellion against the United States, with the loyal states becoming known as the Union during the ensuing American Civil War. In a speech known today as the Cornerstone Address, Confederate Vice President Alexander H. Stephens described its ideology as being centrally based \"upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and normal condition\"."

Police Brutality happens to all walks of life, whites, Hispanics, blacks all alike. I think black people only want to play the victims and truly do not what to see change.

Anti lgbtq sentiments are huge in the black community and when does BLM start to address th\u00e1t because that is also the reason all this black trans women are getting murdered . Because and that is the second observation , BLM is started by 3 women where 2 are queer and 1 married with a transgender male . Let that sink in for a moment . But to me it seems you are really not interested in cleaning your own house .  Because where is the outrage and marches for this women ,  I not seeing them . Where are the speeches towards many black men that by murdering this trans woman a toxic mentality is uphold . Where is the support for all black parents with a transgender child ?

Now you  are free to experience the capitalist system of the US and work as free men and women, don't \"screw up\" and lose your freedom and remember the democrats made you slaves and the Lincoln gave you your freedom.   Had we not had slavery in America the blacks would still be slaves in Africa or may have been shipped to Arab  countries and been castrated and used as slaves, many died from this mutilation   The South breed the million dollar black athletics of today and the North gave them their freedom.

Go back and trace your contracts. Under the direction of the Manhattan District Manager, John Borucinski and Unit Manager Laura Perez, Rental Sales Associates of both Avis and Budget were directed to bundle up the price and quote it to walkin customers. The bundle includes, all insurance coverage of $39 + XM Radio $13 + Car charger $10 = $62 per day. Imagine, how much you pay extra, if you rented a car for 7 days. John Borucinski and Laura Perez, directed the Rental Sales Associates, from May2017, not to bundle up the price after, their subsidiary company, Payless, was slapped with a class action lawsuit, because of this same dishonest practice, which is followed in Manhattan locations of Avis and Budget.

Those who rent from Manhattan, New York, plz beware that if you were a walkin customer between December 2015- April 2017, then you were completely ripped off by hundreds of dollar. Go back and trace your contracts. Under the direction of the Manhattan District Manager, John Borucinski and Unit Manager Laura Perez, Rental Sales Associates of both Avis and Budget were directed to bundle up the price and quote it to walkin customers. The bundle includes, all insurance coverage of $39 + XM Radio $13 + Car charger $10 = $62 per day. Imagine, how much you pay extra, if you rented a car for 7 days. John Borucinski and Laura Perez, directed the Rental Sales Associates, from May2017, not to bundle up the price after, their subsidiary company, Payless, was slapped with a class action lawsuit, because of this same dishonest practice, which is followed in Manhattan locations of Avis and Budget.

So intimidating or using Africans living in Africa as a shield so the US Congress will not cancel Obamacare or making a revenge against Africans living in Africa once Obamacare has been cancelled are crimes against humanity.

You must stand on a higher ground.\"  Since the day the nation was founded, Blacks, Asians, Latinos, Women and Gays were not recognized as equal fellow human beings.  True justice cannot be served until we address the unconscious biases that exist and permeates our society.  We'd like to share a transformative message - Are you greater than the sun/that shines on everyone: Black, Brown, Yellow, Red and White/ the sun does not discriminate (c) 1985 Sara Ting.  This also inspired a song  that was sung at the United Nations and a program, \"Singing Equality across America and around the World.\"  The song moved one teacher to teach the entire school of 429 students the song and even do it in sign language.  You can see the video at: ",

                "160352143",
                ".  As you watch it imagine if all the children in America and around the world learned the song and it lived in their hearts into adulthood the impact it could have on the next generation.  We need to plant the seeds of equality early.  Imagine if the children had an opportunity to sing the song to public officials, law enforcement, law makers and industry leaders the impact it would have.  Hope you'll share.  Thank you for your leadership and support.  Keep speaking out and letting your voice be heard!"

This is confirmed by a surveillance video from the shop that Sterling has recently threatened the store owner with his gun. Sterling wouldn't keep his hands on the hood of the car and got into a physical scuffle with the officer. Sterling then reached for his pocket where his weapon was kept and one of the officers called out that Sterling had a gun and tried to seize his hand before it could get to the gun. The officer wasn't able to, so shots were fired into Sterling. Police then found the revolver in Sterling's pocket. This shows that this shooting was justified, and that if the police didn't shoot him he would have shot them. This is all backed up by video.

Already our black students are more likely to receive office referrals and be suspended; now they will have to worry about being shot? And, while I don't believe that most teachers would open fire in anger on students, why do we risk one tragedy? Weekly we see viral posts of racist comments made by teachers. And even if no one actually gets shot, why inject more fear into schools? But, the people who are making this suggestions don't care about the feelings or safety of children of color.

Just as Donald Trump started a football league to compete against the NFL, Colin will do the same. He has achieved the social status of MLK and Mohammad Ali. His league will offer Roger Goodell twice what the NFL will in order to stick it to the NFL. Patrick Mahomes will be offerred one billion dollars for a 10 year contract. The only issue will be whether Colin will play in his league because it would give the appearance of impropriety. I hope he chooses to play. I believe they will honor America by singing \"America the Beautiful\" and that Colin will stand with his hand on his heart."

Over 30% of welfare in America goes to the 12% population of blacks in America verses 10% on welfare of the 17% of latinos in the total population of America. Feel free to go see what other black people live like in other countries because Lincoln freed black and white slaves a long time ago here. There are more latinos that live in America now than black but they seem to need less welfare. Why is this? Why are half of all the murders in America committed within this 12% of our black population? If someone is able to respectfully reply I will be happy to debate."

Some of us choose good, some of us choose evil, just like non-autistic people. I already have quite a few autistic police shooting victims on my memorial site--many of whom were also black--and I am getting worried. I urge BLM to work with disability rights groups like ADAPT to demand justice and equality for people with disabilities, because like always, disabled black people get an even more unfair deal than usual. Everyone take care, hold your loved ones close... we'll get through this."

Her father, Eric Garner, was murdered at the hands of the New York Police Department on July 17, 2014 as he cried out over and over \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d Our hearts mourn for and with the Garner/Carr family, and we celebrate Erica\u2019s life and work. Her beautiful, powerful, loving, genuine spirit will continue to inspire us.'",
        "' This movement is not about creating martyrs. We don\u2019t believe in martyrs, and we do not believe in people becoming ancestors too soon. Erica was 27 years old, a fighter, a mother of two young children, a warrior; a woman who is beloved. Erica died of a heart attack but her death was anything but natural; she died at the hands of a state that builds healthcare systems that neglect the needs of Black women and Black mothers in particular, a state that is engaged in a war on Black people, a state that has constructed and deploys a policing system that directly kills Black people and indirectly murders our families and loved ones by forcing them to engage in a never-ending struggle for justice under this current system. Erica\u2019s death stands as a stark illumination of the ways in which police violence also takes an unimaginable toll on our families: emotionally, spiritually, financially, and physically.'",
        "' The families of those killed by the state need as much ease and support we can give them and the knowledge that they do not bear their losses alone. We will double down on our efforts and fight harder for a world where Black people are living and thriving and loving and healing. May we all step into our sacred duty to engage fully in the struggle for justice and freedom for our people. In the name of Erica Garner and all Black people who have been murdered directly and indirectly by systems of antiBlack racism and white supremacy.'",

Third, we dissociate our selves from obamacare, we consider that this stolen project can not be associated with us and also we can not tolerate that we are being taken as victims everytime that USA Congress needs to pass a bill against obamacare. (fyi: this is an African stolen project..) so intimidating or  Using African living in Africa as a shield so the US Congress will not cancel Obamacare or making a revenge against African living in Africa once obamacare has been cancelled are crimes against humanity.

This young man is a former foster child and is suffering from a lack of community in Florida, he has a heart condition, I'm guessing from so much stress of being shuffled around in the system.  Would you post his Kickstarter and or do what you can to network him with good people to help him find discounted housing or any resources. Despite his hardships he is working to help others. He needs help too.   Thank you  ://",

Third, we dissociate our selves from obamacare, we consider that this stolen project can not be associated with us and also we can not tolerate that we are being taken as victims everytime that USA Congress needs to pass a bill against obamacare. (fyi: this is an African stolen project..) so intimidating or  Using African living in Africa as a shield so the US Congress will not cancel Obamacare or making a revenge against African living in Africa once obamacare has been cancelled are crimes against humanity.  Last, we will never tolerate direct verbal attacks or direct threats made trough some channels like CNN towards us, by mentioning some names, we consider that as weakness,"

Third, we dissociate our selves from obamacare, we consider that this stolen project can not be associated with us and also we can not tolerate that we are being taken as victims everytime that USA Congress needs to pass a bill against obamacare. (fyi: this is an African stolen project..) so intimidating or Using African living in Africa as a shield so the US Congress will not cancel Obamacare or making a revenge against African living in Africa once obamacare has been cancelled are crimes against humanity. Last, we will never tolerate direct verbal attacks or direct threats made trough some channels like CNN towards us, by mentioning some names, we consider that as weakness, ..."

Third, we dissociate our selves from obamacare, we consider that this stolen project can not be associated with us and also we can not tolerate that we are being taken as victims everytime that USA Congress needs to pass a bill against obamacare. (fyi: this is an African stolen project..) so intimidating or Using African living in Africa as a shield so the US Congress will not cancel Obamacare or making a revenge against African living in Africa once obamacare has been cancelled are crimes against humanity.

All the indians who stayed are not on the population census now, but here is the real thing, it is \"recorded\" that between 2000 and 6000 Cherokee died, so either 2000 people or three times that much, they just arent sure.",

While Northup may be a real name, its funny how he just happened you have a \"true story\" of being taken a slave and freed and has some record of his slavery.... i think someone just picked the name northup because it had the word north in it and made a story about slavery up"

The hypothesis to be tested: Can a people taken from the jungles of Africa and forced into slavery be fully integrated as citizens in a majority white population?",
                " The whites were descendants of Europeans who had created a majestic civilization. The former slaves had been tribal peoples with no written language and virtually no intellectual achievements. Acting on a policy that was not fair to either group, the government released newly freed black people into a white society that saw them as inferiors. America has struggled with racial discord ever since.",
                " Decade after decade the problems persisted but the experimenters never gave up. They insisted that if they could find the right formula the experiment would work, and concocted program after program to get the result they wanted. They created the Freedman\u2019s Bureau, passed civil rights laws, tried to build the Great Society, declared War on Poverty, ordered race preferences, built housing projects, and tried midnight basketball. Their new laws intruded into people\u2019s lives in ways that would have been otherwise unthinkable. They called in National Guard troops to enforce school integration. They outlawed freedom of association. Over the protests of parents, they put white children on buses and sent them to black schools and vice versa. They tried with money, special programs, relaxed standards, and endless handwringing to close the \u201cachievement gap.\u201d To keep white backlash in check they began punishing public and even private statements on race. They hung up Orwellian public banners that commanded whites to \u201cCelebrate Diversity!\u201d and \u201cSay No To Racism.\u201d Nothing was off limits if it might salvage the experiment.",
                " Some thought that what W.E.B. Du Bois called the Talented Tenth would lead the way for black people. A group of elite, educated blacks would knock down doors of opportunity and show the world what blacks were capable of. There is a Talented Tenth. They are the black Americans who have become entrepreneurs, lawyers, doctors and scientists. But ten percent is not enough. For the experiment to work, the ten percent has to be followed by a critical mass of people who can hold middle-class jobs and promote social stability. That is what is missing. Through the years, too many black people continue to show an inability to function and prosper in a culture unsuited to them.",
                " Detroit is bankrupt, the south side of Chicago is a war zone, and majority-black cities all over America are beset by degeneracy and violence. And blacks never take responsibility for their failures. Instead, they lash out in anger and resentment. Across the generations and across the country, as we have seen in Detroit, Watts, Newark, Los Angeles, Cincinnati, and now Ferguson, rioting and looting are just one racial incident away.",
                " The white elite would tell us that this doesn\u2019t mean the experiment has failed. We just have to try harder. We need more money, more time, more understanding, more programs, more opportunities. But nothing changes no matter how much money is spent, no matter how many laws are passed, no matter how many black geniuses are portrayed on TV, and no matter who is president.",
                " Some argue it\u2019s a problem of \u201cculture,\u201d as if culture creates people\u2019s behavior instead of the other way around.

                " The experiment has failed. Not because of culture, or white privilege, or racism. The fundamental problem is that white people and black people are different. They differ intellectually and temperamentally",

I bet if this victim were still white, but  poor or mentally ill there'd be less of a double standard here. I feel that should have been briefly touched on. Also, can we point out the double standard and still condemn the shooting... I know BLM does, but maybe it needs to be made a little more clear in the article. I fear people will read this and think we have no sympathy for the victim or worse yet defend the officer just because he is Somali."

I am glad that this group holds policing accountable and demands better standards from our law enforcement. That said I hope the administrators and leaders here are responsible with their messaging and celebrate likewise good policing. I can't imagine living in a society where there was no police protection. I think women and children would very quickly become targets for nefarious evil men for which the world has a plenty. There are places in the world without police and central government and they are the ugliest evil places on earth. I hope that BLM does not get caught up in their own hype and throw the baby out with the bath water. I am a white, suburban, conservative woman, and I don't appreciate being called a racist. I don't judge skin color, I judge character and ideologies. I am a critical thinker that digs into both sides of an opposition topic to get the truth and I would encourage you (BLM LEADERS) to please do the same. My grandson is both black and white and before he gets old enough to interact with the world outside our loving protection, I would this wound to be healed in our country. My grandson is an individual who does not belong to one group or another , he deserves to stand on his own two feet and be judged based on who he is as a person. I don't want him to be identified as a minority and the derogatory status that is attached to that label. His name is Isaiah and he is my heart and soul and I love him. He does not deserve to live in such a hostile world where black and white are manipulated to be pitted against each other and where paranoia fuels hostility. Please work these feelings out quickly and perhaps get to know some white people that are not condescending liberals trying to prove to you they are not racist. I am sure they are not but, but do you really need their condescending help? Let's have real conversations and get to know eachother as individuals."

I can't help but think, what if something happens to me, and I never got the chance to share this, the truth, and nobody else sees this and does anything about it, and the world remains hurt from all the prejudice and racism? It really could help, lets please give it a try. I need your help. Spread the word!",

So powerful it seems almost impossible to fix the damage it has done and in some cases continues to do to our society and its thinking. I'd like to think things have changed and in many cases it is better, but lets face reality, it still lingers. I do understand that many people are not racist, do protest against it and make efforts to help fix it. I would like to introduce a simple idea. The truth, and spreading the truth. Educating the public of this simple fact, that we are all the SAME COLOR, tan. Just take a minute to think about it, in your mind, if you took every different \"color\" of people, lined them up from the lightest shade to the darkest shade, you could easily see that it is all the same color. It only varies from light to dark depending on the amount of sun you are exposed to and the amount of melanin in your skin. How is it any different? Are there purple people? Blue people? Green people? Ok, occasionally a person might have a tinge of an actual color due to an illness or temperature, but it is only brief. In reality it is all the same tan. All you have to do is really look and think, for only a moment.",
                " Some of us may already realize this. Only, not enough. I feel it is my duty, my dream to get society as a whole (every society) to understand this simple fact. It really could help change the world and get the ball rolling on the healing process. So much damage has been done and from the very bottom of my heart and entire being I am so sorry to everyone and anyone that has ever been hurt and still afflicted by this stupidity. I wish it never happened but since nobody can change that it did, I will do my duty to try and find ways to heal us, please help."

                " Politicians on both sides of the aisle spend a majority of their time raising money to finance their reelection campaigns.   The rest of the time is spent arguing with the opposing party to give the illusion that they are actually attempting to govern.  There is one subject that is toxic to both parties and that is Universal Healthcare.  With healthcare being 20% of our GDP, this should be the number one issue and the government should be trying to put forth long-term solutions.  The Republicans want to simplify the tax code while the Democrats want the rich to pay their fair share.  These two issues can be solved with universal healthcare.  Whether you're rich or poor, everybody should pay 10% of their income for universal healthcare without any caps on net income.  These funds would be paid into an account similar to SSI or FICA.  The only argument left would be the quality of coverage that this would give to all Americans.  In my opinion, that coverage should be a $500 deductible with 20 / 80 coverage for up to $10,000, and then the universal healthcare will pay for anything above.  In other words, you would never pay more than $2,500 in any given year.  This coverage would not cover vision or dental insurance.  Insurance companies would now offer supplementary insurance to pay for that 20% (similar to AARP).  This supplementary insurance would still promote competition within the market which would keep the quality of coverage high.  Public-sector workers would lose nothing if the government would pick up the cost of this supplementary insurance.   Private-sector employees who had been covered by their employer would no longer require it and could be given a one-time pay raise to restore the lost value of losing those benefits. ",
                " ",
                " Let\u2019s do some basic math.  We currently have about 90 million people that can\u2019t afford coverage because they are either underemployed or completely out of the work force; indirectly, the government ends up footing the bill when these people have emergency room visits or unpaid doctor bills.  We have about 50 million people on welfare, disability and social security.  There are approximately 20 million public-sector workers and most of them are married with children.  There is an additional element to this equation that is often overlooked.  About 20% of our economy is based on government contracts for the private sector.  Some examples are road construction and military equipment contracts.  These private-sector workers are well-paid and have excellent insurance coverage that is very similar to that of public-sector workers.  When you add up all of these disparate groups of people who already have healthcare coverage through the government, we\u2019re really not that far away from universal healthcare as things stand right now.

                " ",
                " The whites were descendants of Europeans who had created a majestic civilization. The former slaves had been tribal peoples with no written language and virtually no intellectual achievements. Acting on a policy that was not fair to either group, the government released newly freed black people into a white society that saw them as inferiors. America has struggled with racial discord ever since.",
                " ",
                " Decade after decade the problems persisted but the experimenters never gave up. They insisted that if they could find the right formula the experiment would work, and concocted program after program to get the result they wanted. They created the Freedman\u2019s Bureau, passed civil rights laws, tried to build the Great Society, declared War on Poverty, ordered race preferences, built housing projects, and tried midnight basketball.",
                " ",
                " Their new laws intruded into people\u2019s lives in ways that would have been otherwise unthinkable. They called in National Guard troops to enforce school integration. They outlawed freedom of association. Over the protests of parents, they put white children on buses and sent them to black schools and vice versa. They tried with money, special programs, relaxed standards, and endless handwringing to close the \u201cachievement gap.\u201d To keep white backlash in check they began punishing public and even private statements on race. They hung up Orwellian public banners that commanded whites to \u201cCelebrate Diversity!\u201d and \u201cSay No to Racism.\u201d Nothing was off limits if it might salvage the experiment.",

A group of elite, educated blacks would knock down doors of opportunity and show the world what blacks were capable of. There is a Talented Tenth. They are the black Americans who have become entrepreneurs, lawyers, doctors and scientists. But ten percent is not enough. For the experiment to work, the ten percent has to be followed by a critical mass of people who can hold middle-class jobs and promote social stability. That is what is missing.",
                " ",
                " Through the years, too many black people continue to show an inability to function and prosper in a culture unsuited to them. Detroit is bankrupt, the south side of Chicago is a war zone, and the vast majority of black cities all over America are beset by degeneracy and violence. Blacks never take responsibility for their failures. Instead, they lash out in anger and resentment.",
                " ",
                " Across the generations and across the country, as we have seen in Detroit, Watts, Newark, Los Angeles, Cincinnati, and now Ferguson, rioting and looting are just one racial incident away. The white elite would tell us that this doesn\u2019t mean the experiment has failed. We just have to try harder. We need more money, more time, more understanding, more programs, and more opportunities.",

Some argue it\u2019s a problem of \u201cculture,\u201d as if culture creates people\u2019s behavior instead of the other way around. Others blame \u201cwhite privilege.\u201d",
                " ",

                " ",

They outlawed freedom of association. Over the protests of parents, they put white children on buses and sent them to black schools and vice versa. They tried with money, special programs, relaxed standards, and endless handwringing to close the \u201cachievement gap.\u201d To keep white backlash in check they began punishing public and even private statements on race. They hung up Orwellian public banners that commanded whites to \u201cCelebrate Diversity!\u201d and \u201cSay No to Racism.\u201d Nothing was off limits if it might salvage the experiment.",

They are the black Americans who have become entrepreneurs, lawyers, doctors and scientists. But ten percent is not enough.

Detroit is bankrupt, the south side of Chicago is a war zone, and the vast majority of black cities all over America are beset by degeneracy and violence. Blacks never take responsibility for their failures. Instead, they lash out in anger and resentment.",

                " ",
                " The whites were descendants of Europeans who had created a majestic civilization. The former slaves had been tribal peoples with no written language and virtually no intellectual achievements. Acting on a policy that was not fair to either group, the government released newly freed black people into a white society that saw them as inferiors. America has struggled with racial discord ever since.",
                " ",
                " Decade after decade the problems persisted but the experimenters never gave up. They insisted that if they could find the right formula the experiment would work, and concocted program after program to get the result they wanted. They created the Freedman\u2019s Bureau, passed civil rights laws, tried to build the Great Society, declared War on Poverty, ordered race preferences, built housing projects, and tried midnight basketball.",
                " ",
                " Their new laws intruded into people\u2019s lives in ways that would have been otherwise unthinkable. They called in National Guard troops to enforce school integration. They outlawed freedom of association. Over the protests of parents, they put white children on buses and sent them to black schools and vice versa. They tried with money, special programs, relaxed standards, and endless handwringing to close the \u201cachievement gap.\u201d To keep white backlash in check they began punishing public and even private statements on race. They hung up Orwellian public banners that commanded whites to \u201cCelebrate Diversity!\u201d and \u201cSay No to Racism.\u201d Nothing was off limits if it might salvage the experiment.",
                " ",
                " Some thought that what W.E.B. Du Bois called the Talented Tenth would lead the way for black people. A group of elite, educated blacks would knock down doors of opportunity and show the world what blacks were capable of. There is a Talented Tenth. They are the black Americans who have become entrepreneurs, lawyers, doctors and scientists. But ten percent is not enough. For the experiment to work, the ten percent has to be followed by a critical mass of people who can hold middle-class jobs and promote social stability. That is what is missing.",
                " ",
                " Through the years, too many black people continue to show an inability to function and prosper in a culture unsuited to them. Detroit is bankrupt, the south side of Chicago is a war zone, and the vast majority of black cities all over America are beset by degeneracy and violence. Blacks never take responsibility for their failures. Instead, they lash out in anger and resentment.",
                " ",
                " Across the generations and across the country, as we have seen in Detroit, Watts, Newark, Los Angeles, Cincinnati, and now Ferguson, rioting and looting are just one racial incident away. The white elite would tell us that this doesn\u2019t mean the experiment has failed. We just have to try harder. We need more money, more time, more understanding, more programs, and more opportunities.",

                " But nothing changes no matter how much money is spent, no matter how many laws are passed, no matter how many black geniuses are portrayed on TV, and no matter who is president. Some argue it\u2019s a problem of \u201cculture,\u201d as if culture creates people\u2019s behavior instead of the other way around. Others blame \u201cwhite privilege.\u201d",
                " ",
                " But since 1965, when the elites opened America\u2019s doors to the Third World, immigrants from Asia and India\u2013people who are not white, not rich, and not \u201cconnected\u201d\u2013hav",

While the children of these people are winning spelling bees and getting top scores on the SAT, black \u201cyouths\u201d are committing half the country\u2019s violent crime\u2013crime, which includes viciously punching random white people on the street for the thrill of it that has nothing to do with poverty.",
                " ",
                " The experiment has failed. Not because of culture, or white privilege, or racism. The fundamental problem is that white people and black people are different. They differ intellectually and temperamentally",
                ". These differences result in permanent social incompatibility",

They don\u2019t understand that white people aren\u2019t out to get black people; they are just exhausted with them. They are exhausted by the social pathologies, the violence, the endless complaints, and the blind racial solidarity, the bottomless pit of grievances, the excuses, and the reflexive animosity.",

                " The whites were descendants of Europeans who had created a majestic civilization. The former slaves had been tribal peoples with no written language and virtually no intellectual achievements. Acting on a policy that was not fair to either group, the government released newly freed black people into a white society that saw them as inferiors. America has struggled with racial discord ever since.",
                " ",
                " Decade after decade the problems persisted but the experimenters never gave up. They insisted that if they could find the right formula the experiment would work, and concocted program after program to get the result they wanted. They created the Freedman\u2019s Bureau, passed civil rights laws, tried to build the Great Society, declared War on Poverty, ordered race preferences, built housing projects, and tried midnight basketball.",
                " ",
                " Their new laws intruded into people\u2019s lives in ways that would have been otherwise unthinkable. They called in National Guard troops to enforce school integration. They outlawed freedom of association. Over the protests of parents, they put white children on buses and sent them to black schools and vice versa. They tried with money, special programs, relaxed standards, and endless handwringing to close the \u201cachievement gap.\u201d To keep white backlash in check they began punishing public and even private statements on race. They hung up Orwellian public banners that commanded whites to \u201cCelebrate Diversity!\u201d and \u201cSay No to Racism.\u201d Nothing was off limits if it might salvage the experiment.",

A group of elite, educated blacks would knock down doors of opportunity and show the world what blacks were capable of. There is a Talented Tenth. They are the black Americans who have become entrepreneurs, lawyers, doctors and scientists. But ten percent is not enough. For the experiment to work, the ten percent has to be followed by a critical mass of people who can hold middle-class jobs and promote social stability. That is what is missing.",
                " ",
                " Through the years, too many black people continue to show an inability to function and prosper in a culture unsuited to them. Detroit is bankrupt, the south side of Chicago is a war zone, and the vast majority of black cities all over America are beset by degeneracy and violence. Blacks never take responsibility for their failures. Instead, they lash out in anger and resentment.",
                " ",
                " Across the generations and across the country, as we have seen in Detroit, Watts, Newark, Los Angeles, Cincinnati, and now Ferguson, rioting and looting are just one racial incident away. The white elite would tell us that this doesn\u2019t mean the experiment has failed. We just have to try harder. We need more money, more time, more understanding, more programs, and more opportunities.",

When one considers that of the sixteen hundred million people living upon this earth, more than twelve hundred million are colored, this seems a truly staggering burden.",

It is easy to maintain an ex parte argument, and as long as we do not ask the other side to state their case our own arguments will appear not only convincing but conclusive. But in the court of common sense this method is not generally allowed and a case is not considered closed until both parties have been heard from.",

                " This handwritten note dated October 23, 1920 is as close  Hubert Harrison came to a personal creed. This is one my favorite of his writing.",
                " I think Hubert Harrison is saying that Christians think those who are not part of their faith don't have the capacity for morality but he begs to differ, and that we should treat each other with respect even though we differ in opinion and it takes nobility to salute the presence of another. He also discuss his desire to love humanity for humanity's sake and also that to live eternally is not something he, nor I would desire. I think that if a person can feel bliss in heaven then they can also feel boredom. I don't see how people can feel bliss when their love ones are burning on the other side of the gulf. I agree with Harrison in that I would like to live perhaps for several hundred years but after a while one would want to rest from existing and all that comes from existing. As I concluded that for life to have a meaning or a point it must have a beginning and an end and to continue in an afterlife makes this life meaningless because it would be a never ending story and after while one would get bored with a continuous neverending story.Hubert Harrison (April 27, 1883 - December 27, 1927). The St. Croix, Virgin Islands-born Hubert Harrison, known as \"the father of Harlem radicalism,\" was a brilliant writer, orator, educator, critic, and political activist in New York in the 1910s and 1920s. Historian J. A. Rogers, in \"World's Great Men of Color,\" refers to Harrison as \"the foremost Afro-American intellect of his time\" and (amid chapters on Booker T. Washington, William Monroe Trotter, W. E. B. Du Bois, and Marcus Garvey) emphasizes that \"none of the Afro-American leaders of his time had a saner and more effective program.\" During the 1910s and 1920s Harrison was a major influence on A.

Although blacks make up only 10 percent of the U.S. civilian labor force and about 12 percent of the overall population, about 18 percent of the federal work force is black. Twenty five percent of employees at Treasury and Veterans Affairs are black, and 31 percent at the State Department. Thirty Seven percent of the Department of Education employees are black, 38 percent of Housing and Urban Development, 42 percent of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 55 percent of employees at the Government Printing Office, and 82 percent of the Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency are also black.

And certainly many businesses also lower the bar in hiring.",
                " ",
                " In fact, it is clear that an African American student who applies himself or herself in school and stays out of trouble will actually have a much easier time when applying for advanced education and jobs than someone who is not \u201cburdened\u201d by the legacy of slavery.  However, there are elements that hold back African Americans, including their extremely high incidence of legal infractions (black young men, comprising perhaps only 3% of the U.S. population annually commit over 50% of U.S. homicides), drug usage, and sociologically,",
                " the very damaging problem of out of wedlock births and the lack of fathers in the home. That is certainly a cause of poverty and instability in black culture. But there are those in the African American community who insist that the real cause for blacks being held back is racism and the lack of opportunity for blacks in our society. It would be much more productive if they spent less time playing the blame game, and more time trying to correct the issues in their communities."
