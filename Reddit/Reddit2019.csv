0,,You don’t get an award for not being racist.,8,edu7aj,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/edu7aj/you_dont_get_an_award_for_not_being_racist/,35,2019-12-22 11:32:28,[deleted],"I agree to the aspect you shouldnt be asking for an award behaving like a decent person.

I apply the same logic to fat people . You shouldn't get an awarded for not being a fatass and now being a normal person.

What's your point here? 

Any rational person k's going to agree racism is bad. 

Is your point that BLM is a good thing? Again, don't think any rational person would argue that. 

Is your point that decency is expected of us all, again same thing. 

Don't get what's unpopular about this opinion. 

Racism bad, people good = good.

[deleted]

Not being racist is like being nice.  Of course you're supposed to be that way, but it's fine to recognize it as well.  


I am tired of how not being racist is dismissed if you're not into beliggerent left-wing activism.  Like the only way to support POC is to vote Democrat and join Antifa.   Forget that manipulative and dishonest nonsense.

If you have a problem with BLM (which I won’t even debate on here lest you miss my point) protest against racist cops, mass incarceration, or police brutality. All those things dismantle racism

Protest against maternal mortality rates in black women. Protest against the xenophobia and oppression against Latino people in America.

You don't get award for being of color.

BlackLivesMatter is racist itself so...

Blacklivesmatter is a racist movement All lives matter is the real movement to support if you actually care about people

I can’t even comment on this one. I don’t know know much about the body positive/fat activists stuff

but you did give me a small chuckle

People unfortunately are arguing blm in this thread...

My point was really a reaction to a thread about us giving more credit to people who were raised racist and now are not. 

My point is somehow people find it so novel to not be racist 

unfortunately this is an unpopular opinion: not being racist is the bare minimum

While you agree thats its basic human decency, i can confirm some people find it to be a novel idea

Also please see this thread for people asking for credit for not being racist: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/edl548/people_who_were_raised_to_be_racist_then_made_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

As far as voting democrat and joining antifa- im certainly not saying that. Idk about others on the left though.  I can’t tell you how to vote (being from a Christian background and just understanding democracy I get that everyone has their reasons for voting whatever way they choose). I honestly don’t know much about antifa other than im not for any form of violence.

I do think if you wanna not be racist and actually care about racial equality, getting involved in some of the causes I have already mentioned throughout the thread/my comments are some good ways to dismantle systemic racism. There are others

Cops are more likely to end up shooting a white person. Mass incarceration is the result of mandatory minimum laws not racism. Police brutality is also not as big an issue statistically as you think.

Many more things to protest for. Those are 2 good ones though

Lol who said that?

Being a person of color is just a level of melanin and some features. Why would anyone get an award for being born with more or less melanin?

Yes it is... to idiots.

I want you describe how.

Blacklivesmatter is calling attention to the fact that, in the United States, people of colour are often treated as disposable or of secondary importance by the legal system. There is no Alllivesmatter movement, it's just something people who dont give a shit about institutional racism say to pretend like all lives are treated equally when they arent.

[deleted]

It's already an assumed position by the powers that be that white lives matter. Black lives matter(too) probably should have been the original slogan, but it's implied

Tell me, do you think “Black Lives Matter” means “White Lives Don’t Matter”?

Edit: or any other race, really. Fill in the blanks.

Yes- please feel free to list suggestions i just got mentioned two things that have been weighing on my mind the most. 

Also something on my mind a lot - protest global warming, fossil fuel industries, and divest from these companies. The global south (obviously where many poc live) is already suffering significantly from global warming!

If you have a problem with BLM (which I won’t even debate on here lest you miss my point) protest against racist cops, mass incarceration, or police brutality. All those things dismantle racism

Bud, I like your position, but copy-pasting the same thing on every comment is bad optics.

Why are you talking about white people? You really just assume just because I don't support BLM that I think it has anything to do with white people?

Lol I thought it was efficient. My bad

I don’t know, you tell me. Why do you not support BLM?

It’s just not a good look. Once is done.

Mainly because it only support black people and ignores every other race

I will be providing more causes for people to protest for. Also pm me if you want to get involved in community organizing and need ideas

Which would include white people, hence my comment...

And really, do they? Every member of BLM I talk to is very egalitarian in their beliefs. It’s an egalitarian movement at heart.

using your logic, should we not support cancer research fundraisers because they “ignore” every other disease?

The more I speak to people about her, the more I realize how unfamiliar some people are with her story. (I have been an admirer since 2009.)

Since the holidays often involve more than usual amounts of sitting around, playing with phones, and hanging out, I decided to make a ""playlist"" of what I consider to be ""Elizabeth Warren's Greatest Hits,"" a variety of videos, podcasts, an articles that shaped my respect and understanding of her candidacy. There is a lot of The Daily Show with John Stewart (the format is intimate, the duration is short, and it is really cool to watch her grow into her confidence as a public figure) but other stuff as well. If you have any key media pieces that shaped your Warren support, please share in the comments!

2009 - This is the year that Elizabeth Warren became a public figure to me. Her role in helping to oversee the Toxic Asset Relief program in the immediate aftermath of the subprime mortgage crisis and her first appearance on the Daily Show made her a recognizable player at the national level. She was the only person who really helped me to understand what had happened.

2018-2019 - I had hoped that Warren would run in 2016, so I was super excited when she announced her candidacy in early 2019. I have long been a fan of Robert Reich and really loved [this video conversation](https://youtu.be/6F3EJh6V1cw) that takes place *before* she announces her candidacy. In it Warren discusses her OTC hearing aid legislation which I think is a wonderful example of her pragmatism, compassion, and legislative smarts. I also included her [Town Hall speech from Tempe Arizona](https://youtu.be/Wne-Xz0Yur4) since it's a good example of her early stump speech. It includes stories about her family, her marriages, and her path from teaching, law, and the US Senate. Rebecca Traister's [in depth article on Elizabeth Warren the professor](http://www.thecut.com/2019/08/elizabeth-warren-teacher-presidential-candidate.html) is one of my all time favorites because it shows how her foundation as an educator clearly informs her approach to politics and reveals so much about her integrity and character. I also included the only portion of her [CNN Climate Town Hall](https://youtu.be/go_ELOsVPWg) I could find online. Not many people watched it and I think it's a great example of Warren's depth and commitment to addressing the climate crisis and the way all of her proposals integrate solutions for the climate, economy, democracy, education, social and economic justice. The last speech I have here is her wonderful [Washington Square Park speech](https://youtu.be/kLOmBE6cQB4?t=1069) where Warren references the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire and connects her campaign to the history of women in the labor movement.

Happy holidays! LFG.

Edit- Added an article :)","This one about her favorite bible passage, Matthew 25, is good.  Also if you have any religious folks in your family, remind them she was once a Sunday school teacher.   [https://youtu.be/4hU\_GBs\_8Xw?t=14](https://youtu.be/4hU_GBs_8Xw?t=14)

This post is fantastic! My favorite moment is the speech Obama gave when unvieling the CFPB, he goes into the work Liz did for working folks before the CFPB and her background. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1utEOUOO6fo

Here's the [speech text](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2010/09/17/statement-president-press). My favorite bit is:

>Long before this crisis hit, she had written eloquently, passionately, forcefully, about the growing financial pressures on working families and the need to put in place stronger consumer protections.  And three years ago she came up with an idea for a new independent agency that would have one simple overriding mission:  standing up for consumers and middle-class families.

>Thanks to Elizabeth’s efforts, as well as the dedication and persistence of the person to my right, Secretary of Treasury Geithner, as well as leaders in Congress like Chris Dodd and Barney Frank, that agency will soon become a reality.

>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which was one of the central aspects of financial reform, will empower all Americans with the clear and concise information they need to make the best choices, the best financial decisions, for them and their families. 

If every democrat watched that speech Liz would be polling at 60%.

I love this so much! It's so perfect with everything really important. Thank you for posting it.


If you haven't read this I think it's well worth the read, though it's not for everyone. Biggest takeaway for me was when Barney Frank said ""“I said, ""Well it’s a win-win. Either you appoint her and she gets confirmed or she is rejected and she wins the Senate seat,” Frank recalls. “And he said, ‘Do you think she wants to be a senator?’ And I said, ‘I think she wants your job but she’s got to start somewhere.""

Wow, what a fantastic post!  LFG!

I just love this clip. it's mostly a fun clip something that might be able to break the ice with someone looking for a candidate. I think her team spirit, quick wit and leadership is on full display here as she helps the Bodega Boys get out of an escape room. 

[Completing an Escape Room w/ Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D) | DESUS & MERO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUVwRIQkaIM)

This is (just barely?) pre-politics/academic Warren - a lecture about consumer prices and bankruptcy and family structure. But when I saw this lecture, I think when the CFPB fight was going on, that's when I wanted her to run. She doesn't just get the problem, she can teach you how it happened, and how we can solve it. 

It's about an hour long - unless your family is a bunch of weirdos, it's too long to watch after the family dinner. But maybe something to watch and learn later.

Came out in 2004 and a new version came out in 2016 (which I haven't read yet but have on order!)

Great! Yes. Thank you. Definitely useful. I especially appreciate the way it contrasted so starkly with Trump's response to the same question.

Of course, she's memorized this section in the KJV translation. And then delivered an effective 2 minute sermon + call to action.

Now I want her to give a series of sermons on the economic justice in the Bible.

Nice! Yes. I like the Obama connection too. I think I have a few family members for whom this would be particularly meaningful. Thank you :)

That is one of my favorite articles. Taking on your allies and not alientating yourself is a serious skill.

Oh, yasss! I love this one.

Hope it’s useful to others! LFG!

LOL! I am dying! I’ve never seen that one before. That was so darn cute and funny. And yet also, EW is so clearly smart and solutions oriented. The end where she gets a talking point in about the sailors wages. Ha! My heart hurts trying to make more space to love EW even more after that. Thank you! I have some younger (voting age) cousins who will definitely enjoy this.

Some of my family are total weirdos. Long standing tradition of listening to money lessons, etc. Looking forward to this. Thank you :)

She was a Sunday school teacher so maybe she could give you that.

The #1 canvasser for Warren said telling people that Elizabeth Warren was a Special Advisor to the President during Obama's time was a winning message.

It's immensely useful. Thank you! LFG!

2,meatetchings,I canceled my subscription to Starz since A.G. Fired Jones.,286,ebezld,https://www.reddit.com/r/americangods/comments/ebezld/i_canceled_my_subscription_to_starz_since_ag/,65,2019-12-17 05:14:21,"My wife and I talked it over and decided the other programming was not worth it, now that Orlando Jones was fired for his angry interpretation of Anansi. Having been a long time Neil Gaiman fan and reading almost all of his books, Orlando Jones Mr. Nancy was one of my favorite parts about this show. I’m done.

#hirebackjones
#freemrnancy
#blacklivesmatter","Did you read Anansi Boys? The whole time I was reading that book (which I read after watching season 1) I was thinking of Orlando Jones in that role. 

He’s brilliant, and he was one of the best parts of the show, if not the best. 

Trying to place any of the Gods on some sort of moral high ground completely goes against the core tenants of the story. Gods are not perfect, nor good at their cores. 

Are they going to say Biliquis is too sexy next??

I'm not entirely sure Jones would even want the job back at this point, and I'm absolutely sure that I really don't care about the remainder of the series, even if he came back. 

I doubt there will be much past season 3, with the absolute shitshow that was made after the amazing news that was season 1.

First Gillian Anderson, now Orlando Jones? [sigh] I’m out.

I think the whole thing is weird. If they are following the books he shouldn't be in the next few seasons. And by their statement it sounded like that's all it was. He would come back in the last few episodes but his part of the story is done.  
  
In the other hand they clearly tried to add a side plot line with him last season, and just abandoning it like that is suspicious. And I don't think an actor would go on like that publicly if he didn't feel he had good reason. 
  
What a mess

Nancy was my favorite but even beyond him, half of the cast is gone now. The show simply isn’t worth watching anymore in its current state. Maybe someone will try again with AG in a decade.

Reading OP again, I had to laugh at how it kind of seemed to channel Mr. Nancy’s anger. Would have loved to see Orlando make a Mr. Nancy burner acct here and unleash on this sub.

I think the problem is that people who are essential to the series are gone, fired, and for me, that means the end of the show.

I can't understand their logic behind the firings, but I can say this if every single firing reported here is true then this series is done.

He’s hands down one of the best parts of the show and honestly lakewood is not nearly interesting enough until the end to keep my attention for a full season. Between this and the Jinn I have no hope for S3.

Combined with Mraish not being asked to return I really worry about what they are planning.

Well not worry, because I'm not watching anymore. But disappointed in the showrunners.

Nancy was probably my favorite part of the show. Not that I don’t like the rest but he was just the most interesting. I might get starz to check out the next season again but this could kill the show and if the runner doesn’t understand he’s taking a gamble he’s very mistaken. This could easily ruin the show

The scene on the slave ship was the best scene of the entire series.

Recently had to change my cable package to get a bette price and had to give up Starz. I told husband I would add it back onto our account when the new season starts and cancel once finished, but not any more!

I like how their reasoning was ""We fired him because Anansi isn't in the section of the book we're focusing on this season.""

Fucking Mad Sweeney is in TWO SCENES in the book.  Laura is in, like, what, five?  Okay, boomer.

I'm upset Orlando fit Mr Nancy perfectly. I read this book yearly and since seeing this Mr Nancy that is all I can see in my head. Not like this for another character on the show

Same. No more. Jones was the show mostly for me. #angrygetsshitdone

I wouldn't have had a problem if the split was amicable. Sometimes stories change direction and things change. But the way this went down( Starz letting the two clips of Mr.Nancy and his speeches go viral even though they knew he was no longer on the show etc.) Starz,freemantle and chuck yourself did him I cant fuck with them or the show anymore

#CancelAmericanGods

Yeah, the whole thing is ridiculous. They say it's because the next season doesn't include him--well that's a HUGE MISTAKE. This  show has tanked. I enjoyed the first season, but they've shot themselves in both feet now.

Anansi is cut, the Jinn is cut, Hinzelmann is a woman.

Yeah, you know, I think we're done here.

Obviously I live under a rock, what happened? Orlando Jones got let go from American Gods?

Me too 😐😐

This whole thing is just people not ok with change, it's really interesting how radical and intolerant some are about works of fiction.

it’s too early for this.

fuck blacklivesmatter, alllivesmatter

That about Bilquis is exactly what I was thinking lol

Maybe Mr Wednesday will be fired because the new show runner doesn’t want to promote being manipulative, or Laura because he doesn’t want to promote infidelity...

The day that all characters have to be role models is the day storytelling dies.

> Are they going to say Biliquis is too sexy next??

*""We're sorry but we don't feel that consuming worshippers during sex represents the ideals we wish to portray for modern black america.""*

Hell yeah I read Anansi boys! Jones interpretation was fantastic, and tbh the next best rendition of the character. The more I learned about the mythology of Anansi the more inline his version seemed with how the character may be today.

And Kristen Chenoweth and Chris Obi.

I think if it were just ""he's not in this season,"" it would've been handled differently. The showrunner could've said: ""Hey, your character isn't in this part of the story, but we'd like to bring you back in Season 4.""

At this point in his career, Jones has had many roles. He spoke up about this situation, and I believe him.

Jones says on Twitter:
*So according to @americangodsus and @FremantleUS  Chic Eglee , The show runner and myself clashed, let’s be clear I HAVE NEVER had a conversation or met the showrunner, he never once reached out to me or called me!! He sent others to do his dirty work....*

https://twitter.com/TheOrlandoJones/status/1206523961611292672

You noticed 😉

He was my favorite character 😭

Agreed. Each scene with Nancy drew me in, fascinated me and made me uncomfortable as a white guy. I watched the slave ship scene five times after episode 2 of season 1 came out. The ""Another one gone.""speech was even deeper. Every line Nancy says is the truth. Otherwise, I wouldn't feel nearly as uncomfortable.

I know. They seemed to be going somewhere really good with him.

And she isn't nearly as bitchy or cruel as she is in the show. Every scene with Laura just bored me and we have to watch HER and not Mr.Nancy? Screw that. 

Mad Sweeney fights Shadow, asks for his coin back later and then is found dead. Hell, the Djinn and his lover are only in the short story segment together in the book, then they're gone.

The Jinn is out too?

... I don’t think Hinzelmann’s gender is at all relevant to the plot.

https://youtu.be/DFVivVGKpB8

The best character on the show will not be able to reach his arch 😥

It’s not so much that as it is how *much* change there has been with this show. With so many characters getting dropped, it’s really damaging any sense of continuity.

Is that you Elgee?

If I wanted life lessons I would watch Sesame Street. This show runner is fucking up the entire show and it’s such a waste of excellent source material.


Additionally, this is so stupid because they can literally go online and read fan reactions and I don’t see anywhere where fans were reacting negatively to jones’ portrayal of Mr Nancy, in fact, I’m quite sure most folks loved it.

🤣

And Mousa Kraish and Crispin Glover.

I think I agree with your assessment. He's been working in TV 20 years, he's not stupid enough to risk a working relationship with a whole studio unless he had good reason. I can't believe how many setbacks this show has faced. The first season I was telling everyone that I know that I hadn't enjoyed a first season of a show this much since Game of Thrones, and now a few years later I can't believe the trainwreck it's become.

i'm glad he called fremantle out by name, and is connecting with gabrielle union about it - it was a horrible place to work but they're very under the radar so you can't get the same kind of traction

The thing is the show has various characters with much bigger roles than they had in the canon as well and changed stuff around for 'not in that part of the book' seems... flimsy

Yeah, sorry to break it to you this way but he has not been asked back for season 3.

It's pretty relevant to the culture that his mythology is derived from. 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinzelmann

Well that's awful news

Dude, don’t bother. This guy comments on every thread about the issue to get mad that people are upset. If you engage, he starts hurling personal insults.

And?

I hope they’re reading fan reactions now.

Chick Eglee, if you’re reading this, there is a quote from a character I suspect you’re going to cut which I think applies to you:

“Fuck you, fuck your mother, and fuck that fucking horse that you rode in on”
-Czernobog, s2 e1. 

#Save American Gods (from itself)

FFS. This series had so much potential when it started.

and don't forget abt New Media.

It's not just him either. Gabrielle Union from America's Got Talent(which is connected to the same production agency as Starz)was told her hair was ""too black""and she was in contact with Jones and they were supporting each other after their removal. She apparently had to deal with many racist incidents. 

Link: [https://www.allure.com/story/gabrielle-union-americas-got-talent-controversy](https://www.allure.com/story/gabrielle-union-americas-got-talent-controversy)

This entire trashy adaptation could have easily been a 3hr GREAT movie or a mini series.

I had stopped watching it after what they did to Laura's character and now.... well... They fired the only thing that was holding it together

Well that sucks

Yeah, I read that whole article you linked, and it says absolutely nothing about sex or gender of the kobold.

You know, I think that Peter Stormare's interpretation of the Slavic God of Death and Misery Czernobog might be too angry too. Better cut that out, wouldn't want slavic people to get the impression that anger is a way to solve problems.

Well the article is about one specific male kobold so you obviously didn't read it that intently.

Imagine a deity literally called “the Dark/Black God” being angry!

BY GODS! HE MUST BE REMOVED!

Genuinely if what he’s done with Anansi is anything to go by the new guy might actually replace Czernobog with Bilobog for that reason.

Perhaps I am not being clear. There is nothing about the Hinzelmann mythology that is sex or gender specific. The article about the kobold Hinzelmann uses the pronoun “he,” however switching the pronoun to “she” changes nothing about the mythology. Does that help?

Yeah, cultural insensitivity isn't really a good idea to me but sure.

I’m super open to evidence that Hinzelmann’s gender matters to the kobold’s original culture and the plot of American Gods. Let me know if you find any.

Man, if you can't understand why arbitrarily altering the gender of a cultural deity for no other reason than to garner woke points is culturally insensitive then that's on you.

There was a time in America when being called a socialist could end a political career. Not anymore.

By Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor

Dr. Taylor is the author of “From #BlackLivesMatter to Black Liberation.”

Dec. 10, 2019

As the Democratic primary elections get closer, the party leadership has begun to fret in public about universal health care and other ambitious proposals. Even former President Barack Obama tried to assuage donors’ fears in November when he said that the “average American” doesn’t think we need to “tear down the system and remake it.” His comment captured the essence of tensions that have roiled the party for months. Party elites believe focusing squarely on President Trump’s record will end his presidency, while others counter that the Democrats also have to champion bold policies.

The surprising resilience of the campaign of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont vindicates the latter approach. Mr. Sanders’s improbable rise to Democratic front-runner began in 2015 when he organized his campaign for president around a redistributive agenda of universal health care and free college, along with a number of other progressive reforms. Party insiders dismissed this as fanciful and out of touch, but Mr. Sanders aggressively challenged Hillary Clinton for the nomination while picking up 13 million votes.

Mr. Sanders has not diluted his message since then, but has instead recommitted to his promises of “big government” socialist reforms — all the while pulling other candidates to his side. Although Mr. Sanders grows in popularity, neither the Democratic Party establishment nor the mainstream media really understand his campaign. That’s because it disregards conventional wisdom in politics today — tax cuts for the elite and corporations and public-private partnerships to finance health care, education, housing and other public services.

After months of predictions of its premature end, Bernie Sanders’s improbable run continues its forward movement. In October, pundits and other election experts suggested that perhaps Mr. Sanders should leave the race and throw his support to Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, in the wake of her rising poll numbers and his heart attack. But doubts quickly gave way to excitement when Mr. Sanders captured the coveted endorsement of Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota. She was soon joined by Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan.

The spirited endorsements of three-quarters of the so-called squad illustrates how Mr. Sanders’s campaign has grown from 2016 when it was criticized for being too white, too male and for underestimating the salience of race and gender oppression. Some of that criticism was overstated. Indeed Mr. Sanders won 52 percent of the black millennial vote in 2016 and was supported by Black Lives Matter activists like Erica Garner, who passed away in 2017. But Mr. Sanders took the criticisms seriously anyway.

Much of the media, though, has been stuck in 2016 and has missed the ways that the Sanders campaign has transformed into a tribune of the oppressed and marginalized. We can also measure this change in the endorsement of Philip Agnew, the former head of the Florida-based Dream Defenders and a leader in the Black Lives Matter movement who has become a campaign surrogate. As well as the endorsement of the Center for Popular Democracy Action on Tuesday, a powerful coalition of more than 40 progressive community groups which will now rally their 600,000 members across the country to organize voters in support of Mr. Sanders. These developments defy the caricature of his campaign as impossibly sexist and implicitly racist.

Instead, Mr. Sanders has reached the typically invisible, downwardly mobile working class with his language of “class warfare.” He has tapped into the anger and bitterness coursing through the lives of regular people who have found it increasingly impossible to make ends meet in this grossly unequal society. Without cynicism or the typical racist explanations that blame African-Americans and Latino immigrants for their own financial hardship, Mr. Sanders blames capitalism. His demands for a redistribution of wealth from the top to the rest of society and universal, government-backed programs have resonated with the forgotten residents of the country.

Since Mr. Trump’s election, “class,” when it’s discussed at all, has been invoked for its hazy power to chart Mr. Trump’s rise and potential fall. Recall the endless analyses of poor and working-class white voters shortly after his election and the few examinations of poor and working-class people of color. But the Sanders campaign has become a powerful platform to amplify the experiences of this multiracial contingent.

Under normal circumstances, the multiracial working class is invisible. This has meant its support for Mr. Sanders’s candidacy has been hard to register in the mainstream coverage of the Democratic race. But these voters are crucial to understanding the resilience of the Sanders campaign, which has been fueled by small dollar donations from more than one million people, a feat none of his opponents has matched. Remarkably, he also has at least 130,000 recurring donors, some of whom make monthly contributions.

Adding to that, Mr. Sanders is the top recipient for donations by teachers, farmers, servers, social workers, retail workers, construction workers, truckers, nurses and drivers as of September. He claims that his donors’ most common employers are Starbucks, Amazon and Walmart, and the most common profession is teaching. Mr. Sanders is also the leading recipient of donations from Latinos as well as the most popular Democrat among registered Latinos who plan to vote in the Nevada and California primaries. According to Essence magazine, Mr. Sanders is the favorite candidate among black women aged 18 to 34. Only 49 percent of his supporters are white, compared with 71 percent of Warren supporters. Perhaps most surprising, more women under 45 support him than men under 45.

Mr. Sanders’s popularity among these voters may be what alienates him within the political establishment and mainstream media. The leadership of the Democratic Party regularly preaches that moderation and pragmatism can appeal to “centrist” Democrats as well as Republicans skeptical of Mr. Trump. It is remarkable that this strategy still has legs after its spectacular failure for Hillary Clinton in 2016.
Mrs. Clinton’s rejoinder to Mr. Trump that “America never stopped being great” was tone deaf to millions of ordinary Americans struggling with debt, police brutality and pervasive inequality. Simply focusing on the boorishness of Mr. Trump or offering watered-down versions of what has made Mr. Sanders a household name will not motivate those who do not typically vote or angry voters who recoil at the cynicism of calculating politicians.

In many respects, Bernie Sanders’s standing in the Democratic Party field is shocking. After all, the United States government spent more than half of the 20th century locked in a Cold War against Soviet Communism. That an open and proud socialist is tied with Ms. Warren for second place in the race speaks to the mounting failures of free market capitalism to produce a decent life for a growing number of people. There was a time in America when being called a socialist could end a political career, but Bernie Sanders may ride that label all the way to the White House.",

Brazil had a ton of this including American productions Fast (and Furious) Five and the video game Max Payne 3.

That said, the idea that cops are corrupt and hate black people is old hat in American cinema and it probably won't change the political filmmaking landscape.

Over the decades we have The Glass Shield, Copland, Boyz N The Hood, Do the Right Thing, Leon The Professional, Crash, and LA Confidential off the top of my head.

while we have had many cops are bad and hate black people I think something of a feature of this new stuff is.

&#x200B;

Even the good cops aren't all that good.

Queen and Slim (go see this movie btw)

&#x200B;

has maybe 1 good cop but it showed why good cop is an oxymoron. (that ending will stick with me forever. )

&#x200B;

21 bridges fucking sucked. but it sucked because it so unashamedly showed the cops as this badass thing net good making the killing of cops equipped like the fucking army locking down an island for 2 fucking criminals look sad and when you do that you run into the reality of what cops are. (it also sucked because the Russo's are fucking hacks)

&#x200B;

thats why I like that it failed because you cant just do that anymore without people knowing its a bunch of propaganda. 

&#x200B;

Black and Blue tried to portray cops as bad but it didn't do a great job at it and seemed to sort of confused on what it actually wanted to fucking say.

10 years ago I was the guy chained up to a tree, 5 years ago I was the guy blocking the street trying to get your attention to stop eating meat. I was arrested, ridiculed and ""roughed up"". Now I’m just tired. I’m a Ph.D. in int.relations with a specialization in climate conflicts

[Here]( https://www.futuretimeline.net/forum/topic/17231-climate-change-scientific-paper-library/) you’ll find 30,000 scientific papers about this fu*ked situation.

5 years ago there was a tv show called The Newsroom. It was mostly a serious tv show with some comedic tones about the world of media. There is a [famous 5 minutes clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uc1vrO6iL0U) about climate collapse. It was ""comedic"" back then however now it is the reality. 

#Global Warming:

[According to a 2018 report]( https://www.climatecentral.org/gallery/graphics/the-globe-is-already-above-1c) the have the current global temperature is above 1C the pre-industrial mean.

*1.5C* - This used to be the point at which scientists thought we were OK. In 2018 the IPCC wanted to stop global warming at this temperature predicting we will hit it with a 10% chance by 2023. At this temperature, heatwaves across the globe will happen every single year, and these 'new' heatwaves will be as hot as the Sahara Desert. There will be massive crop destruction, 70% of coral in the ocean will be bleached, and drought will affect 360M people.

## Biomass and 6th extinction

Earth appears to be undergoing a process of ""biological annihilation."" Up to half of the total number of animal individuals that once shared the Earth with humans are already gone. A 2017 study looked at animal populations across the planet by examining 27,600 vertebrate species — about half of the overall total that we know exist. They found that more than 30% of them are in decline. Some species are facing total collapse, while local populations of others are going extinct in specific areas. Moreover humans wiped out 60% of animal populations since 1970 [Source]( https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/30/humanity-wiped-out-animals-since-1970-major-report-finds)

Roughly 40% of the world's insect species are in decline, according to one study. Insects aren't the only creatures taking a hit. In the past 50 years, more than 500 amphibian species have declined worldwide — and 90 have gone extinct — due to a deadly fungal disease that corrodes frog flesh. [Source](https://www.businessinsider.com/signs-of-6th-mass-extinction-2019-3?IR=T)

And Plants are going extinct up to 350x faster than the [historical norm]( https://qz.com/africa/1694276/plants-are-going-extinct-350-times-faster-than-normal/)

On the other side, [Look at the explosion](https://i.imgur.com/dXdidBf.jpg) of domesticated animals between 1950 and 2000. Cattle is one of the causes of  global warming. Ie. The Amazon is being cut down not for lumber but to make room for cattle [Source]( https://youtu.be/O6DFvW2c4rk)Our hope in her is all the Beyondmeat, Impossible burger which are not using animal protein and are way better for the environment.

## Population

[The steep curve of population]( https://i.imgur.com/5fEjb2t.png). If our numbers grow by 228,000 on an average day, then in one week, we will have added about 1,589,000 extra persons to world population. To prepare for it Humanity must produce more food in the next four decades than we have in the last 8,000 [years]( https://richardvanhooijdonk.com/blog/en/humanity-must-produce-more-food-in-the-next-four-decades-than-we-have-in-the-last-8000-years-the-dutch-may-have-the-solutions/) But we are wasting so much food and losing so much water in irrigation that taking all this into account Society will collapse by 2040 due to catastrophic food shortages. 

## Permafrost and Methane. [Soil in the Arctic Is Now Releasing More Carbon Dioxide Than 189 Countries](https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/arctic-soil-releasing-carbon-dioxide/)

At 2C level we expect 6.6 million square kilometers of permafrost to thaw. And create a feedback loop of releasing a lot of methane which means that melting ice caps and permafrost becomes a self-accelerating extinction. [Already boiling with Methane]( https://www.iflscience.com/environment/seas-boiling-with-methane-on-scale-never-before-seen-reported-in-siberia/) But that is also terrifying because we know that there are pathogens [frozen in that permafrost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSA5HNFBwnk) - pathogens like [anthrax]( https://siberiantimes.com/other/others/news/n0694-20-people-now-infected-by-zombie-anthrax-outbreak-in-siberia-say-officials/).

## Illnesses

As the rest of the Earth warms, animals will be forced to migrate en masse. This means animals carrying tropical diseases (such as malaria. To give you an idea of why this should really scare you is because diseases like camel flu have a mortality rate of 36%. And the world’s hospitals [are not ready for the health challenges of climate change]( https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/u-s-is-unprepared-for-the-health-challenges-of-climate-change-experts-warn/)

[Nearly unbeatable and difficult to identify fungus has adapted to global warming and can now survive the warm body temperature of humans.

Report from the WHO [World at risk](https://apps.who.int/gpmb/assets/annual_report/GPMB_annualreport_2019.pdf). They listed dozens of illnesses that the experts suggested had the potential to trigger an outbreak which could spiral out of control, among them the plague, Ebola, Zika virus and Dengue. A flu-like deadly pandemic could sweep the world in hours and kill millions because NO country is fully prepared. A century ago the Spanish flu pandemic infected a third of the world's population and killed 50million people.

[Right now, air pollution in India or China is so high it goes off the chart. Without an airmask you'll get ill](https://aqicn.org/rankings/)

## Topsoil erosion

 We are running out of topsoil [Source]( https://therising.co/2019/04/05/research-shows-we-are-running-out-of-topsoil/), by 2055 we will have none of it [video]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2bBimj0dFU). That's the warning of ""Surviving the 21st Century"" author Julian Cribb to an international soil science conference in Queenstown, New Zealand on Dec 15, 2016. ""10 kilos of topsoil, 800 litres of water, 1.3 litres of diesel, 0.3g of pesticide and 3.5 kilos of carbon dioxide – that's what it takes to deliver one meal, for just one person,"" [Cribb says.]( https://phys.org/news/2016-12-meal-eaten-planet-kilos-lost.html#nRlv). And it takes 2000 years to form 5cm of topsoil. If you don't think this will affect you...just you wait until food becomes the rarest commodity on Earth. If you think you have seen human barbarity, just wait until those same humans are starving and desperate for food. This won't mean millions starving. It will mean billions starving. Including you.

## Scarcity of freshwater

 [India has 5 years to solve the water crisis]( https://edition.cnn.com/2019/06/27/india/india-water-crisis-intl-hnk/index.html), South Africa has the worst drought in 1000 [years]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAvaH_txwGM), Zambia has 2M of brink of starvation thanks to regional [drought]( https://www.news24.com/Africa/News/2-million-on-brink-of-starvation-in-regional-drought-in-zambia-20191030). 
According to the [UN report]( https://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/scarcity.shtml) in 10 years, 4 billion people will be short of fresh water, 2 billion will be severely short of it.

## The Blue Ocean event

 A Blue Ocean Event means that huge amounts of sunlight won't get reflected back into space anymore, as they previously were. Instead, the heat will have to be absorbed by the Arctic. As long as the Arctic Ocean has sea ice, most sunlight gets reflected back into space and the 'Center-of-Coldness' remains near the North Pole. A Blue Ocean Event will not only mean that additional heat will have to be absorbed in the Arctic, but also that wind patterns will change radically and even more dramatically than they are already changing now, which will also make that other tipping points will be reached earlier. This is why a Blue Ocean Event is an important tipping point and it will likely be reached abruptly and disruptively by 2022.[source]( http://arctic-news.blogspot.com/2018/09/blue-ocean-event.html) The arctic ice [volume over the years]( https://haveland.com/share/arctic-death-spiral.jpg) in one chart. It is a Death spiral. 

## The ice sheet feedback loop

 And when it comes to rising ocean levels it's becoming increasingly difficult to predict because not only are we heating the air, heat is getting trapped in the oceans too which means that ice sheets in the Arctic circle and Greenland are melting from above *and* below - meaning they're melting much MUCH faster than we estimated even in our most extreme estimates. [Vice news video about it]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QubYjSTMGs0 ). This will mean that Florida and New York could be completely underwater. If you're worried about refugees from Central and Latin America or Africa, you'll want to start thinking about the tens of millions of people that will be fleeing inland to escape the inundations. [Rising Seas Will Erase even More Cities by 2050](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/10/29/climate/coastal-cities-underwater.html). It [triples our previous estimates](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-12808-z)

## [Wet bulb event]( https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/aug/02/climate-change-to-cause-humid-heatwaves-that-will-kill-even-healthy-people)  

Extreme heatwaves that kill even healthy people within hours will strike parts of the Indian subcontinent unless global carbon emissions are cut sharply and soon, according to new research. Even outside of these hotspots, three-quarters of the 1.7bn population – particularly those farming in the Ganges and Indus valleys – will be exposed to a level of humid heat classed as posing “extreme danger” towards the end of the century. The new analysis assesses the impact of climate change on the deadly combination of heat and humidity, measured as the “wet bulb” temperature (WBT). Once this reaches 35C, the human body cannot cool itself by sweating and even fit people sitting in the shade will die within six hours. [There are already part of thw world above 32-33]( https://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2017/12/22/humidity-may-prove-breaking-point-for-some-areas-as-temperatures-rise-says-study/)

## [Ocean Acidification]( http://science.time.com/2013/08/26/ocean-acidification-will-make-climate-change-worse/) 

Oceans are absorbing a large portion of the CO2 emitted into the atmosphere—in fact, oceans are the largest single carbon sink in the world, dwarfing the absorbing abilities of the Amazon rainforest. But the more CO2 the oceans absorb, the more acidic they become on a relative scale, because some of the carbon reacts within the water to form carbonic acid. If acidification decreases marine emissions of sulfur, it could cause an increase in the amount of solar energy reaching the Earth’s surface, speeding up warming—which is exactly what the Nature Climate Change study predicts. Researchers estimate that the pH of the ocean will drop by 0.4 pH units by the end of this century if carbon emissions are not stopped, or by 0.15 units if global temperature rise is limited to 2C. [source]( https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/21/ocean-acidification-can-cause-mass-extinctions-fossils-reveal) And plankton and all fishes are plunging. There is a mass extinction in the oceans right [now]( https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/ocean-phytoplankton-zooplankton-food-web-1.4927884)

##Why tree-loss prevention is more important than planting them.

[There’s too much CO2 in the atmosphere that planting trees can no longer save us]( https://www.businessinsider.com/so-much-co2-planting-trees-cant-save-us-2017-5?IR=T). However Scientists estimate that we need to plant 1 trillion trees to mitigate the GW. WITHOUT LOSING ONE SINGLE TREE because [a burning tree is releasing all the CO2 back](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2208610-unprecedented-arctic-megafires-are-releasing-a-huge-amount-of-co2/). The amazon is losing 3 football field’s PER MINUTE thanks to [fire]( https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-losing-3-football-fields-worth-of-rainforest-per-minute-2019-8?IR=T). If you prefer an interactive [map](https://fires.globalforestwatch.org/map/). At the moment we are losing 13-15 million hectares per year in South America and Africa and south East Asia because it is converted from a forest to agriculture land. [Source]( http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/40893/icode/). 

So, if we assume that 1M trees’ planted is one step that you make, then 20 meters is 20M trees right? 1 trillion trees are like 2.5x from where you're standing to the International Space station. Not to mention all the pollution by delivering the seeds (or small trees from tree farms), all the logistics in preparing the ground for planting and all the promotion waste etc.  

## Migrations

[Tens, hundreds of millions of climate refugees. MIT source]( https://www.technologyreview.com/s/613342/get-ready-for-tens-of-millions-of-climate-refugees/). By 2050 there will be 1.5B migrants. Yes, it’s in [30 years]( https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/59n9qa/climate-change-will-create-15-billion-migrants-by-2050-and-we-have-no-idea-where-theyll-go?). And it will increase the [potential for conflicts and violence]( https://www.news.iastate.edu/news/2019/02/13/climateconflict). A study by the Pentagon confirms [there will wars caused by migrants]( https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-23/pentagon-fears-confirmed-climate-change-leads-to-war-refugees). Just an example of top of my head.

There will be a rise of fascism and concentration camps. Trump already tried this with the camps south and China is doing terrible things to Uighurs [my comment about the crimes against the Uighurs](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/dmen7s/in_blow_to_china_eu_gives_human_rights_prize_to/f50mafz/). We will see a rise of this over the next 30 years.

##The super-rich

The rich know that it is too late and they will be the only one to survive the global warming [article]( https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/climate-change-apartheid-poor-iraq-effects-heatwave-a9049206.html).

For example Canada, Norway and Brasil will flood the world with oil just to profit at the maximum [Article from NYT from today ""Flood of Oil Is Coming, Complicating Efforts to Fight Global Warming""](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/03/business/energy-environment/oil-supply.html).

##Why the current economic system is broken:

The current economic system is broken beyond belief and not only in the US but also in Europe, Australia and in Asia. I've been researching this issue for years (privately) because I was appalled by how bad it really is.

[The ultra-rich are holding up to $32 trillion, excluding non-financial assets such as real estate, gold, yachts and racehorses, in offshore accounts.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-offshore-wealth-idUSBRE86L03U20120722)

[Visualization of $50K, $1M and $1B](https://i.imgur.com/rcf4zmh.png). The median income in the US is $32,000. If each step on a staircase represents $100,000 of net worth then HALF of the people in the US are on the base or the very 1st step. Almost 200 million people who can't even get one step up in this system. The households on the 80th percentile are on the 5th step. That's about five seconds of walking to get up there. A billionaire is ten thousand steps up the staircase. That's enough to walk up five Empire State buildings. From these heights, they couldn't tell the difference between a millionaire and a homeless even if they wanted to. And Jeff Bezos? That's more than halfway to the space station. That's more than 24 consecutive Mt. Everest's stacked on top of each other.

If you had a job that paid you $2,000 an HOUR, and you worked full time (40 hours a week) with no vacations, and you somehow managed to save all of that money and not spend a single cent of it, you would still have to work more than 25,000 years until you had as much money as Jeff Bezos. Of course, we are talking about all his assets but don’t forget that Jeff is selling his shares from time to time. [Sold $1B of stock in 2017]( https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/3/16604990/amazon-ceo-jeff-bezos-stock-sale-1-billion ) and [Cashed out $1.8B in 2019]( https://observer.com/2019/08/jeff-bezos-cash-billion-amazon-stock-fund-blue-origin/). He reinvested the money but nevertheless, he is able to cash it out. Btw, [how working in a warehouse is terrible for you but great for Bezos]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9m7d07k22A)

##The future is grim (automation)

*Manual automation*: There are entire towns in the US build around factories or mines. If you automate the factory and close the mine plenty of people will lose their job and fail into the drugs trap. [How unemployment is tied with illegal drug use](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0955395917300877). Humans need a goal, should it be work, volunteering or creating. Without one most of us feel useless and without a purpose. Additionally, a mine closing down causes extra mass layoffs in such a town. [It is called the ripple effect. A mine closing down = x3 more job loss for a town](https://youtu.be/ylLTMYt24lA). Another link [What happen when a factory town closes down](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/05/01/magazine/lordstown-general-motors-plant.html) Least we forget, Trump won the presidency because he promised to give back the jobs' lost. [Out of the 8.9M promised he created only 154k](https://projects.propublica.org/graphics/trump-job-promises)

*Intellectual Automation*: I also don't approve the explanation that automation is creating more jobs. The current automation is not the same as 200 years ago or 100 years ago where industrialization replaced the physical workforce. Now we see our brains replaced. And I get that, companies to stay afloat need to move with the current and need to R&D cut costing methods like automation. However, it is not a long-term solution because there's a point where the population had it enough. Most society revolt when someone is attacking their helpless or close ones. A famine, a natural disaster or shady government are toppled because the population doesn't have enough means to help their families. [ Why do civilizations collapse](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/03/why-do-civilizations-collapse/). 

The 1789 revolution happened because [The people of France were growing increasingly more upset with treatment they received from the upper and royal classes, mainly due to special privileges](https://www.britannica.com/event/French-Revolution). The 1917 was similar in cause. Families lived just above the subsistence level, and around 50 percent had a member who had left the village to find other work, often in the towns. As the central Russian population boomed, land became scarce. This way of life contrasted sharply with those of rich landowners, who held 20 percent of the land in large estates and were often members of the Russian upper class. [source](https://www.thoughtco.com/causes-of-the-russian-revolution-part-1-1221800). The great depression of 1929 had only [8% of unemployment rate](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdf/10.1257/jep.7.2.41)

As you may see we are getting closer to the same causes as 200 years ago and 100 years ago. Rich getting richer and forcing ""peons"" out of work thanks to automation.

How can you retrain a 50 yo trucker? How can you tweet #learntocode to a 55 years old maid? It is a crime against humanity but this time caused by greedy corporations trying to move aside the unpredictable part of the machine - Us. No more sick leaves, no more PTO, no more maternity leaves.

""Designing ourselves out of the picture, little by little, scoffing at the idea that we’ll ever actually succeed at it. Playing a grand game of chicken, trying to push machines as close as possible to a complete set of human capabilities without getting so close that it begins to ask uncomfortable questions like “why am I working for you instead of myself”.""

The percentage of jobs to be automated in the next 10 to 20 years is 70% for the low-skill jobs, 46% for the middle-skill level. And as we all know, most of the population works in these 2 categories and [their wage didn't grow since 1979](https://miro.medium.com/max/1216/1*TxloVjyL5TXkrD4YUJjPOA.png) .

Now take these 10M to 15M and their families (x3) so 30 to 45M Americans without a salary. It's 1/6th of the country. You have a revolution.

Even if all accountants, lawyers, clerks and truck drivers go for trade you can't have 200 million plumber, electricians, and gardeners in the States... Let's be real. The ONLY one to profit from it will be Bezos and his peers. [Jeff Bezos abruptly cuts health benefits for nearly 2,000 part-time Whole Foods workers](https://www.salon.com/2019/09/13/jeff-bezos-abruptly-cuts-health-benefits-for-nearly-2000-part-time-whole-foods-workers/).

#Conclusion

## Why going green is not the solution.

Costs of going green are insane and the global economy is unable to bear the brunt of this mass switch. Going 100% green energy is not possible with the current consumption. Earth lacks enough [metals]( https://lokisrevengeblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/heay-metal.jpg?w=696) to produce solar panels, batteries and ways to distribute energy around the globe.  Building one wind turbine requires 900 tons of steel, 2,500 tons of concrete and 45 tons of plastic.  Solar power requires even more cement, steel and glass—not to mention other metals. Global silver and indium mining will jump 250% and 1,200% respectively over the next couple of decades to provide the materials necessary to build the number of solar panels, the International Energy Agency forecasts. World demand for rare-earth elements—which aren’t rare but are rarely mined in America—will rise 300% to 1,000% by 2050 to meet the Paris green goals. If electric vehicles replace conventional cars, demand for cobalt and lithium, will rise more than 20-fold. That doesn’t count batteries to back up wind and solar grids. [Source]( https://www.wsj.com/articles/if-you-want-renewable-energy-get-ready-to-dig-11565045328) [A periodic table of elements that we are running out of]( https://www.fastcompany.com/3044467/a-periodic-table-of-elements-that-the-world-is-running-out-of) And China controls 90% of all rare minerals [source]( https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/rare-earth-mining-china-social-environmental-costs)

A single electric-car battery weighs about 1,000 pounds. Fabricating one requires digging up, moving and processing more than 500,000 pounds of raw materials somewhere on the planet. The alternative? Use gasoline and extract one-tenth as much total tonnage to deliver the same number of vehicle-miles over the battery’s seven-year life.

[The new green deal is not enough](https://medium.com/@joshuafkon/the-world-is-not-going-to-meet-the-necessary-emission-reductions-even-a-green-new-deal-wont-12230cb9f3a7). The Developing World Is Increasing Emissions At Such A Rate That Any Emission Reduction By The Developed World Will Be Offset. Even if we imagined that the political will could be found in both the United States and the European Union to spend trillions on a Green New Deal, and we made the somewhat generous assumption that these plans would be successful in achieving net zero emissions by 2030, it would really have no meaningful impact on global carbon emissions thanks to China, Africa, India and South America.

Same with a meat tax. We can impose a tax on meat in the developed countries but China, India or South America are eating more and more meat by the day. [According to Asia Research and Engagement's report ""charting Asia's protein journey"", meat and seafood consumption in Asia will rise 33% by 2030 and 78% from 2017 to 2050](https://www.foodnavigator-asia.com/Article/2018/12/03/Expert-analysis-Meat-and-seafood-consumption-in-Asia-will-rise-78-by-2050)

### [Peak Copper]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_copper)

An international team of researchers has looked at the material demands and pollution that would result from a push to get the globe to 40 percent renewables by the middle of the century. The analysis finds that despite the increased materials and energy demands, a push like this would result in a dramatic reduction in pollution. And for the most part, the material demands could be met, with the possible exception of copper.  40% Green Energy requires 200% more [copper]( https://www.climatecentral.org/news/renewable-energy-needs-huge-mineral-supply-16682) 100% green energy requires 500% more copper. We move some 3 billion tons of earth per year to get 15 millions tons of copper. We cannot recycle it into existence. Substituting aluminum for copper takes 5X the energy and is less safe. [And there is no substitutes for the metals]( https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/d73zvm/there-are-no-substitutes-for-the-metals-in-your-smartphone)

#Why nobody talks about collapse?

[Collapse doc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olda6UNMRD4)

Why does nobody talk about collapse? Because a world without hope is a burning world. Imagine 7B people realizing they don’t have 50-70 years but 20 or 30. It’s pure chaos. Additionally, the wealthy of this world are trying promoting such work ethics that you don't have the time to read, watch or study the above. This endless cycle of working-buying stuff-sleeping is damaging our society. We are becoming more and more ostracized from each other by using technology like FB or Tinder.

For more: /r/collapse","Awesome right up man. The thing I always find so funny is when it’s said that this will all only happen *if* we don’t act right away! I think I’ve seen a few things just today that said that. How long are we saying that for? What’s right away? A month? A day? A year? I’ve known about climate change for well over a decade now (I’m young lol) and absolutely nothing worth noting has been done about it. We aren’t going to do shit, we can’t even agree that all versions of our own species are equal, there’s no way we’re going to be able to agree on what to do about a problem many if not most people don’t even think is that big of a deal. My father in law thinks it’s a big joke and he’s got grandchildren, man. Like fuck! We are fucked.

Holy fuck why does this not have more interactions? Hats off to OP, very well researched and spoken. People need to read this.

Holy fuck dude. I just read this whole thing (I need to go back and check some of your links) and I have to say, well done on collecting all of this information

This is depressing. More people need to hear this

Any solutions from any commenters are welcome, because right now I have no idea what to do

Already seeing the rise of authoritarianism in my country (Australia). They are arresting whistleblowers, raiding the homes of journalists and trying to ban climate protests.

Wow.  It feels like you've compiled all of my thoughts and opinions and posts into one big post/book with references.

Thanks.

As for our future, I have some suggestions on ways to both survive and thrive for the poor:

* Building your own tiny house is actually pretty smart with dramatically lower material and labor costs for a simple, efficient design, except current zoning laws will basically forbid you from living anywhere near a city.  They're upcharging the fuck out of them for sale though.
* Over 80% of energy demands in Canada go to heat.  Seal off your house from air/water penetration completely, not just partially.
* I determined that heating an individual person costs approximately 1% as much as heating a house.
* Raspberry Pi 4 draws vastly less power than even a laptop.
* E-bikes are powerful and effective enough for most people.  Warning though, because they're upcharging the fuck out of them.
* Vertical farming and growing some fruits and vegetables at home can not only offset your costs, but it could mean the difference between starving and just getting by.  But you have to do it now - farming isn't something you can start doing instantly.
* Look up liquid nanoclay.  It could help if we could work out how to make it as a matter of public domain recipe.

Maybe change the title to “Why you need to start living, and loving. Right. Now.”  It might get more traction on other subs?   “Never forget this was somebody’s idea.”  is also an option.   

But IT IS a shit-ton of horribleness (nice job btw. Thorough as) and will freak a lot of people out.   Like the guy said, people freaking out would’ve been great.  20 years ago.  But freaking out to ‘make a difference’ means changing way too much and forcing an end to inequality.   And probably lots of violence, given that inequality is enforced by a thin blue line. 

Most climate news is like watching a gasoline tanker drive towards a brick wall in slo-motion with the kids screaming at their parents while the parents (who are facing backwards) text each other about GOT.

I’ve been watching the “doomers” for about 5 years now.   At first I thought the backlash might be warranted, but then I started actually reading the papers.  

It is an incredible sickness, greed.   In Australia, Canada and the US, government/military assessments have determined that global warming is a threat to sovereignty, and more importantly an existential threat to COMPLEX LIFE.  

It’s so sad I had to stop paying attention.  This planet and all it’s life is a precious jewel and I will enjoy it until I can’t.  Let’s just hope that Bezos et. al haven’t already secretly built their colony ships.

Be kind whenever possible.   It is always possible.

This post should be stickied so when people ask why someone is all ""fatalist"" and ""doom and gloom"" we can point to this post, tell them to go read it, and then come back with a good argument if they can even make one.

This should be stickied.

Thanks for the legendary summary. It's important to get to the bottom of things efficiently in the internet era.

####On the economic front:

You say ""**the current system is broken**"" and point to myriad examples of gross inequality. But it's more than just the wealth gap. It's ""too big to fail"" and the illusory financial sector on which the American economy - and by extension, the world economy - is based.

The excellent Matt Taibbi's book *The Divide* has an interview where a law enforcement investigator essentially says, ""white collar crime is completely rampant. but we can't do anything about it, because finance now constitutes such a large slide of the economy that prosecuting it in any serious way that would actually discourage it, would have such deleterious effects it would plunge us into another Depression.""

In that case, even if it might just be railing against windmills, what could someone do on an individual level to help?

FTFY

Doom and gloom porn is seductive. Stories about how things could go terribly wrong often seem really plausible. Yet human life keeps improving by virtually every metric. I can tell you from experience that as time goes by, these concerns will seem less worrisome. It's not wrong to have thought of them and found them worrisome, but the problem is that we already have short lives, and it's easy to squander far too much time worrying about futures that never materialize. It's a fundamental fact about reality that there is only one computer capable of figuring out what's going to happen: the entire universe itself. It is computing the state of the next ""now"" as quickly as it is possible to do so. Your brain is not up to simulating it, nobody's is. If you have so much confidence in your own ability to predict the future that you're spending all your time worrying, your confidence is excessive. Start writing down definite predictions that will happen in a reasonable amount of time and start recording it every time you're wrong, and perhaps your excessive confidence will diminish and be replaced with healthy levels of humility and doubt. Anyway, I hope you feel better.

I really enjoyed reading this. It has been something I have wanted to see for a very long time, and nobody talks about any of this stuff or gets any of the facts straight, and they definitely don't get into scientific details like this. The research you did on this was amazing and I think more people need to become aware of what we're up against in this world.

1999 WAS the best year in human history, like I had stated in a post I made on another subreddit. Global warming hadn't fully overtaken the world then, we had just enough real life and internet interaction to have the best of both worlds and not be completely ostracized from one another, and people in general seemed happier than they do today. 

I think the 2010s decade truly blew chunks. Nobody wants to admit it just like they don't want to admit things are getting worse by the day, but that is because if people knew what the true reality was and found out how bleak their future was, we would be seeing the suicide rate skyrocket. 

I am very scared for our future right now. I wish we could invent a time machine and go back into the past, but it seems like that's not feasibly possible.

Should we be spreading this all over reddit? I don't what the rules are with something like that, but I think going into the apocalypse all on the same page would allow us to prepare together in an ad hoc sort of way.

I don't think this is getting any better. The wealthy/powerful are obsessed with amassing wealth and power which involves empowering the 99.9% of the human species, who will most definitely not be reading this, with the means to destroy the environment.

Meanwhile governments and corporations do nothing but fuel the narrative that everything's rosy in the name of short-term financial gain. Look at all those morons who claim ""I love travelling"", and how anyone who claims otherwise is considered ""socially dysfunctional"". Nobody stops to think how their pastime, their choices and their actions affect the environment because it comes pre-packaged in shiny marketing wank that only shows you pristine blue Caribbean waters and sandy beaches.

I honestly don't think this is changing. Statistically the morons are always going to outnumber smart people, and there are always going to be greedy smart people. If we accept this, one good solution might be effect of our actions would be to reduce the size of the human population. Sadly, again, the greedy elite are never going to allow that because economic growth relies directly on a growing population. It's a vicious circle.

*To be a scientist is to be naive. We are so focused on our search for truth, we fail to consider how few actually want us to find it. But it is always there, whether we see it or not, whether we choose to or not. The truth doesn't care about our needs or wants. It doesn't care about our governments, our ideologies, our religions. It will lie in wait for all time. And this, at last, is the gift of Chernobyl. Where I once would fear the cost of truth, now I only ask: ‘What is the cost of lies?’*

Wow, thank you for putting in the time here. This really should be stickied.   


Also, posts like this make me want to resume smoking again.

Awesome job collecting all this information, I think society’s done for unless major changes to our way of life is adapted by everyone. It’s not too late just yet but it seems inevitably it will be. I’m gonna go ahead and stock up on some bunker food.

Does anyone have a precisely accurate map of the regions of the US that will be most impacted by climate change down? Sell if you live there and move now. This is my plan. I have had difficulty finding accurate climate change projections that are precise enough. Is the northeast the best or will massive snowstorms be regular or would Washington state be better to avoid wildfires to some degree? Those our some of my areas I've been thinking about other than Canada.

Holy cow !

Nice work, dude. Easily the most well sourced post about collapse I saw.

It's indeed looking grim. I wonder at what pace will the world wake to the fact that it's unsustainable at its current pace/growth. And how hard will people react.

You know I've been saying for about a year that society maybe has 20 years left. I didn't have much evidence for it it was mostly just what I felt. I mean it sucks that were all going to die but at least I'll die saying I told you so. Ah fuck that doesn't make it any better. Damn.

Edit: I don't mean to be coy. I've just somehow lost the ability to get worried about this stuff. People have been saying it for years and humanity never listened, I've been saying it for years and no one listened. Shit if it was just humans dying off I'd sit back and watch the show, but it sucks were taking the whole planet with us.

Man fuck this I just wanted to live

Excellent summary. Now try to get the 99% of people whose biggest worry is whether it affects their Monday commute to read this. It's a losing battle.

I think the problem with humans is that we have very short lifespans relative to the speed at which natural processes take place. If we lived 1000-2000 years we would probably worry more about the consequences of our actions.

My parents keep trying to persuade me to start thinking about my retirement early. I'm just not sure my generation will be lucky enough to die of natural causes.

Reminds me of guy mcpherson’s take. I think the point is population reduction is the only viable long term solution. Massive massive massive reduction. Perhaps this is the goal.

God this is a treasure trove of truth. Is there a discord or whatever where you guys discuss more of this u/Logiman43

Thank you for all of this information. I have never seen such a comprehensive presentation of information related to climate change and anticpated collapse.
I hope this gets more traction, I crossposted it to another  sub and plan to send it to a few others.

So I wanted to save this text as a future reference point for discussions about possible cascading systems collapse. Is it possible to somehow easily harvest all the source links? If I just copy-paste the text, I will only get plain text, no URL's of the sources :/

Any ideas?

EDIT:
Managed to get the links over by normal copy+pasting by doing it in Firefox on a friend's computer :) . But thanks for the replies with suggestions :)

Seems like the solution to a lot of this would be a means of energy production that doesn't produce a lot of carbon and gets around the resource scarcity issue presented by solar panels and wind turbines. That solution to me seems to be nuclear, I wonder what you're thoughts are on it?

The facts preaented in OP I know are true. I've known for years that just replacing fossil fuel burning energy with ""green"" sources and replacing our cars with electric ones is not going to solve our problems.

I've known for years that becoming more efficient is what's needed. There are many many ways in which we can become more efficient, less wasteful with energy and materials, especially industry, which produces the lion's share of greenhouse gases.

Here's one source for that: https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/nov/20/90-companies-man-made-global-warming-emissions-climate-change

On a personal level, we can become more efficient by:
- reusing. Far far more efficent and less world impact than recycling.
- using smaller personal transport for your shorter journeys: bicycles, e-bikes, e-scooters etc. Even the electric versions weigh 10-30kg a tiny fraction of the car's 1000kg and more, needing a tiny fraction of the energy, battery capacity, materials.
- give more thought and reduce the distance you travel daily.

Making changes on a personal level is great, but as I mentioned above its a small drop on the bucket compared to industrial emissions. It's not hard to find examples of commercial enterprises doing the cheaper thing instead of the more sustainable thing. This is good business, right? And terrible for the planet. This is the thing that needs to change, ASAP, WORLDWIDE.

The major reason that collapse is so difficult to exactly pinpoint a prediction is compensatory measures.  We're past peak conventional oil, but on a theoretical graph it peaks and gradually declines.  In reality we're doing our best to plateau conventional oil and brining in fracking and shale and have decades of that left.  When that's starting to taper, we're going to convert coal to petroleum just like the Germans did in WW2, natural gas too.  So think of just plateau out for longer rather than declining, but with a sudden cliff at the end because we used up everything feasible to prop up a bloated system and then made it even more bloated.

The simplest explanation is that humans are no different than bacteria growing in a petri dish, consuming everything until it's gone and then it dies.  Or the [imported reindeer on St. Matthew's Island](https://www.wired.com/2009/12/mysterious-disappearance-of-reindeer-herd-blamed-on-freak-storms/) who populated and then overpopulated without constraint until a single extended bout of bad weather drove them all to the breaking point because their system (environment) had no give left.

As a collective species, we're clever but just not very smart.  Clever is figuring out how to use a stick to get the candy beyond our reach.  Smart is constraining our initial instincts and realizing it's might be within our power but not in our best interest.  Right now that candy is bigger everything in chase of a pyramid scheme economy, exponential growth.  [But perpetual exponential growth is not possible in a finite world.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZA9Hnp3aV4)  That is a lie of economists and their graphs.

This post is epic.

OK doomer.

I need to save this post.

Amazon rainforest, jeez this didn't age well

What do we do?

so... should i stock up on water and canned goods?

The best post I've ever seen. I'll save this and study it. Thank you so much.

This further feeds into my existential crisis. We're so fucked. A revolution needs to happen. It's the only way we can change the trajectory of this terrible reality.

Just wanted to say thank you for taking the time to type this out. A lot of these were things that I had heard in passing but not understood the magnitude or significance of.

What are we supposed to do now? Just wait for our terrible destiny?

Another strange leap in logic is not considering illegal immigrants as a threat to the jobs of documented citizens, even though they have the exact same unfair advantage as the automated machines, which you do consider a threat.

Their undocumented status exempts them from income taxes and their employer of state imposed labor costs. Both of which DO apply if he hires a documented citizen. In my country, Belgium, this works out to undocumented workers being at least 4x cheaper than legal citizens, since the employer pays 2/3 of your gross wage to the state and social security, and you pay up to 50% tax on what's left.

Even if legal citizens wanted to compete with these undocumented workers by lowering their own takehome wage to 1/4 that of the undocumented workers, reducing their overall cost to the employer to match the undocumented workers, minimum wage laws make it literally illegal to hire them.

It's both financially and legally impossible to compete with illegal immigrants when it comes to entry level jobs and low skilled labor.

It's extremely ignorant to denounce the legitimate concerns of workers who lose their jobs to unfair competition with ""they took our jerbs"" jokes.

I notice all the shit you're catching from r/climateskeptics is on the thread posted to that sub rather than here in the comments. Knee jerk ""commies in disguise"" stuff

Well said.   The use of oil and it’s by-products is responsible for micro plastics, garbage gyres, hormone disruption in animals and humans, GHG, smog, chemical exposure, probably a lot of cancer (those plastic chains aren’t really stable even within the “accepted temp ranges”)  So, we can’t support so many people using the technology that has brought us so many lifestyle perks.   If humans survive past the next 200 years, they’re going to have to accept this fact, or figure out how to get cold fusion from plastic.

This is great work. Its incredible to me how much is really at stake and happening right before for us.

Welp. You made me shed a tear. I don't think I have it in me to want to have kids anymore. I haven't been through every link but the ones I've clicked are hard hitting.

Basically our world is going the direction of the outer world's, that's what i get from your post

So should I just lay down and die? I'm scared. I don't know what to do.

Overpopulation is the elephant in the room. All other ""solutions"" are useless with a never-ending human population increase. Job 1 has to be not only stopping global population increase, but bring down the number in the the developed world by at least 1/3rd. There is no alternative. You may not like it, but there it is.

Should I just kill myself at this point? It feels like just existing, just having a job and needing to drive is more trouble than its worth. I always wanted to leave this world better than I found it, but it feels literally impossible, so why should I try when all I’m doing by trying to get by is making the world worse?

Man this really makes me want to just off myself
I mean what's the point now

This is stunning...

***THIS is very well put together...also post this in a Wordpress Blog for easy re-post? I'm sharing this and following you-let me know if it happens-I WILL share this everywhere! R***

OP please publish this as a blog or a website in itself. This needs to be more persistent and easily accessible and unapologetically in people’s face. I feel reddit posts are ephemeral.

Thank you (I think) for your comprehensive and very scary synopsis. I believe all of it, as my research throws up similar patterns of degradation, greed, and lack of cooperation.
As a species, we probably deserve to fail.

Just one nitpick to make and that is you assume that private transportation stays the same and every vehicle in existence gets replaced by an electric one. That shouldn't be the case if we hope to even be barely sustainable, **private vehicles are insanely wasteful and should be downright banned**. The only allowable private transportation should be bycicles, possibly electric, at most, while all the rest should be covered by public transport.

Trains, trams (trolleys), cable cars, funiculars, trolley buses, subways and the like DO NOT require (large) batteries on board to function, their impact would be minimal compared to your estimate as all energy storage would be confined to the grid, where much more flexible and sustainable solutions, some of which presented later, are implementable.

There are alternative ways to store energy that don't require huge amounts of rare earth minerals like batteries do. Some of these methods are [compressed air storage](https://nfp-energie.ch/en/projects/1010/) in old mines and tunnels (or new ones can be dug for the purpose), [pumped-storage hydroelectricity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumped-storage_hydroelectricity), [pumped-heat electricity storage](https://energystorage.org/why-energy-storage/technologies/thermal-energy-storage/), and [flywheels](https://energystorage.org/why-energy-storage/technologies/mechanical-energy-storage/). The latter can even be implemented to power short range vehicles, a concept proven viable by the [Gyrobus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyrobus).

wow we're fucked

What you wrote about elon is misleading. His  family was pretty broke when he was  estranged from his father while he was a student in canada

which places are going to be positively affected by the changing climate, canada? new zealand? i wanna know where to buy property to go bunker hunting in about 20-30years

I just came across this comment(s) on r/worldnews and it is seemingly having catastrophic implications on my mind. After reading and rereading all of this, the most prominent question in my mind is how do you go on with your life knowing this information?

If you are actually a PhD in International Relations with a specialization in Climate Conflict, it is obvious you are bipolar and experiencing a manic episode. Get back on your Lithium or start on a drug that works before you murder someone.

I say this because I was constantly typing out manic tirades like this during the early internet and it is impossible to stop. Bipolars like us have thoughts that spiral out of control. Unfortunately, the result is shame, despair and loss.

If you haven't, try a small amount of Lithium, like 250mg. It puts a lid on the endless ruminating and worry. If you feel like tripping out, stop taking it for a few days. I always start taking it again because the horrible memories of past bipolar episodes start coming back.

Do not let the medical professionals put you on 9,000-12,000mg of Lithium because it is ""how we always do it."" Microdosing Lithium is something they have no patience for, but it works amazingly well.

In short... we’re too late.

OP says we have 20 or 30 years. Lol probably said we were all gonna die in 2012 too. And y2k.

It's like a nightmare I can't wake up from. I regret bringing a child into this world. My life will be a nightmare let alone hers. If we die before our time I hope to a non existent God it's not painful or scary.

Thanks much sir , we all know this won't stop but at least we can prepare somehow .

Nice.

I am very appreciative of this post. Thank you for all of your effort.

Forgot one other thing.....WAR.

Welcome to WWIII everyone:/

Here's the problem you and I are faced with, when even a child, with childish hope that adults care is ridiculed, and her Asperger's paraded as some proof of insanity, and science and hard data is vilified.

How can you expect change?

The largest palm trees the world has ever known were on Easter island. The people there built the greatest canoes and navigated great distances regularly.

They eventually cut the last one down, trapping themselves, and killing the last one. Do you imagine some of them might have thought that was stupid? Did it make a difference?

They are a Canary in the coal mine. Our foretelling of our own stupidity.

No one is coming to save us

Sad ward

OP, why didn't you mention nuclear energy?

So should i just kill myself then

This is all just so, so easy. The problem is, humans are so complacent and lazy and we won’t just take a chance on some basic changes to policy. Time is limited here, but very powerful and a little change can do wonders down the road.

:: sigh ::

""Trump already tried this with the camps south (...)""

Stopped reading right there. Get a grip back to reality. This is untrue, so I can assume everything you posted was cherry-picked to suit you. This entire post could be alarmist garbo. No ty.

I am really late to the party, since I just stumbled upon this post, but u/Logiman43 ,during your research did you see anything that might save us from a worst case scenario or is at least a hope to look forward to? What do you believe could be done to achieve a ""good"" result? And where do you think we are headed now?

The future is certainly grim. Perhaps renewables can save us from the catastrophe.

This may sound extreme, but hear me out:

What if we just stop using money? No cash, no coins, no digital currency, none whatsoever.

What if all humans have intrinsic value, and our value can never be quantified?

Food grows in nature. Soil and plants purify water in nature. Shelter can be found or made in nature. We can be safe among communities in nature. Money does not exist in nature. Money is a human construct that does not hold value outside of our beliefs. Every other organism on earth lives without money. Money is not essential for life, human or otherwise.

What if instead of sharing our innovations and creations for personal gain and placing financial barriers on who can benefit from them, we share them for the betterment of humanity and allow others to freely expand on and innovate our work? What if the reward for our work is simply the product of our work, the skills we've acquired, and better quality of life for ourselves and those we've helped? 

If you acquire proficiency at a skill, if you create something, if you simply help another person, people will recognize that. You will still eat, have shelter, have clothes, even without money.

Think about the implications of abolishing money altogether:

No more wealth gap. The ""ultra rich"" and extreme poverty would no longer exist. People would simply be people. A person's influence would be relative to the work they contribute to their community. There would be no incentive for anybody to work to accumulate wealth or resources for any single individual. 

No more government coercion. Our state currently *depends* on coercion to enforce much of its authority. ""The practice of persuading someone to do something by using force or threats."" ""Authority"" is enforced by threats of tickets, fines, fees, jailtime, or in extreme cases your life. People who murder or destroy would be held accountable- we'd regain power to govern ourselves within our communities. If a person in your neighborhood murdered someone and ya'll found out, do you think the community at large wouldn't be able to take the steps to hold them properly accountable - do you think you couldn't do it reasonably and humanely?

No fear of litigation. How many irrational policies are in place because one person did something stupid and sued? This isn't to say we shouldn't be cautious or made aware of risks, but we should be free to make choices for ourselves (and face consequences for ourselves without them being arbitrarily imposed on us). 

No more excessive waste. What incentive would there be for manufacturers to produce in excess, dump waste, or produce superfluous/unnecessary junk if there was no financial gain? Who would litter if they weren't purchasing products wrapped in plastic or foil, but were instead producing for themselves and their communities?

No need for ""professionalism"". No need for ""professional"" clothing (reduce the textile industry), no more pretentious manners of speaking. We could be totally candid and authentic with each other - honest. Think how good this would be for our mental health to simply be transparent! People could still choose to dress how they want or speak how they want, but it would be a *choice* rather than coerced (WTF does anybody's clothing have to do with their ability to perform a particular job (exceptions being a performing group that wants to appear uniform, etc)).

No more war. If we share the resources of this planet, respect each other and nature, what reason is there to produce weapons of mass destruction or destroy foreign lands and people? Who *profits* from wars? Why do you think wars have been *constant* for thousands of years? We could still bear arms, and within communities defend ourselves if an invading force did come along.

No more debt to cripple lives.

We'd regain the starry night sky, even in cities, because light pollution could be minimized. How much light pollution comes from billboard advertisements, auto stores, businesses, empty parking lots, etc? Who is profiting from that energy being consumed? What reason would there be for these people to advertise their businesses/institutions if there was no fiscal profit to be made? When you're done using the factory for whatever you are producing, just shut it off.

More time with families and communities if we don't need to ""go to work"" but can WORK for our communities' needs within our communities! Within our communities we can grow our own food, build our own shelters, raise our own livestalk (humanely), produce our own clothing, and we can use only what we need rather than consuming in excess. 

We can minimize pollution from the transportation industry. If people stay in their communities instead of driving to work every day: less traffic, less smog, less need for oil (which would reduce need for oil rigs, pipelines, fracking, and other toxic industry); we could reduce the number of roads and give that land back to wilderness to help repopulate forests and animals - lives would be saved with less accidents. Insect populations would climb again. We can share cars within communities: have cars/trucks available for those who need them when they need them, and actually open space within our communities: remove driveways and garages from houses (have an area designated for community vehicles), and give space back to nature. 

We can grow orchards where there used to be parking lots or driveways or neighborhood roads. We can allow our dogs and cats to roam freely in neighborhoods instead of being confined to kennels or cages or fences or houses (though if you know a dog is aggressive toward people or animals, you can keep it bound somewhere).

We can open all structures/buildings for any person with need. We *already* have enough buildings on this earth to shelter every living human many times over. How many sky scrapers, office buildings, warehouses are mostly empty at night? How many homes are empty during the day? How many mansions have empty bedrooms *all the time*? What a waste of space! And we keep them locked. Then complain about homelessness. How daft.

We can have sports, games, art, music, and all recreation. We can still have tournaments and concerts and shows, but it will simply be for the love of it without pretensions of prestige.

We can open universities and schools to any person who wants to learn and allow any knowledgeable or skilled individual to teach. 

We can detach from our possessions, because we can't take anything with us when we die, and even if we don't have something in hand *now*, we can be assured that more of those things exist and we will likely hold them again. If every person in your neighborhood revealed every object they owned, how many duplicates would there be? How many things do you own but use infrequently, that could be used by others? If we shared objects among each other, we wouldn't need 40 televisions, 40 cars, 40 drills for 40 people in 40 houses.

We ***already*** have ***everything*** we need to live happy and productive lives. But we've become so selfish. 

For what reason does a single human need a 20,000 sq ft home? 20 pairs of shoes? For what reason does a single human need ""authority"" over the lives of countless others? Does money truly qualify a human to destroy, take or poison the beauty and wealth of our earth for their own gain? 

We wouldn't need inhumane slaughter houses or expansively wasted arable land to produce feed for our meat. We could give that land back to forests and prairies, repopulating large mammals and insects. 

Money seems to cause more problems than it solves. It corrupts people who gain it excessively and burdens those who are unable to ever have it. It divides people and keeps communities disparate. It creates illusions of self-worth that depress some people and inflate others, both undeservedly. It encourages the destruction and consumption of our planet. 

Kinks would need to be smoothed out, because it would be a drastic social change. But we're approaching a point in our history that we ***need*** drastic changes soon- shit is already hitting the fan, and until we stop throwing shit at the fan it's not gonna stop raining on us.

Even current policies are wishful thinking. Policies that exist but are not enforced are as good as nothing at all

Would be good to add the earth-space battery paper:

http://www.pnas.org/content/112/31/9511.full.pdf

Simple knowledge of thermodynamics tells you that the most alarming climate change narratives are garbage.  Temperature especially in water always tries to find a medium so there will continue to be a yoyo of cold and hot as these climate systems have always done. Some areas work out more favorable for thriving humans and other places can be dangerous without proper adaptation.

Well, I have good news, then! The theory of catastrophic anthropogenic climate change is unfalsifiable pseudoscience that doesn't stand up to basic logic.

You see, if you want to argue that there is some sort of disastrous deviation between the current climate and what it should naturally be, you first have to define that natural climate. Something that climate ""scientists"" systematically refuse to do.

That means defining a ""natural"" global mean surface to measure whether the current global mean temperature is ""unnatural"". It means defining a ""natural"" sea level to measure whether the current sea level is ""unnatural"". It means defining a ""natural"" amount of extreme weather events to measure whether the current amount of extreme weather events is ""unnatural"". You get the point.

Only when you define these basic natural values can you logically measure any deviation from the natural climate. The theory of anthropogenic climate change makes no attempt to even try to define these values. Its claim that we are deviating from the natural climate at all is most often based in nothing more than religious dogma and logical fallacies: ""I don't like x about the climate, so it must be an anomaly and therefore caused by man!""

This brings us to the ""unfalsifiable"" part. By refusing to define what our current climate should naturally look like, climate ""scientists"" are refusing to define any criteria under which human beings would NOT be causing climate change. As a direct result of this, ALL possible measurements will always ""prove"" that human beings cause climate change.

This means that no temperature, sea level or amount of extreme weather events that can ever be measured will ever make climate ""scientists"" say that humans are NOT causing climate change.  Not a single set of observed data will ever make climate ""scientists"" pack it all up, refuse the government grants and get real jobs because the planet is saved.

When a thesis is ""proven"" by everything and can be disproven by nothing, that's called unfalsifiable pseudoscience. When opposing measurements in comparable geographic locations both ""prove"" anthropogenic climate change at the same time, that's called unfalsifiable pseudoscience.

Of course, there are more problems with the ridiculous nonsense narrative around anthropogenic climate change.

If you can't even logically assume that our climate deviates from what it should naturally be, because you don't know what the natural climate would be, how can you even measure this deviation?

If you can't measure any deviation between the current climate and what it should naturally be, how can you measure the anthropogenic factor in this deviation, let alone conclude that it is the dominant factor?

If you can't measure the anthropogenic part in this deviation that you can't measure, how on earth can you isolate private sector human activity as the problem? Because to argue for government intervention is to implicate only the private sector as a bad actor. Which is ridiculous if you look at ""high emission"" blocs like the Eurozone where government spending to GDP already reaches 50%, making the state responsible for the vast majority of emissions.

In short: there is no logical basis for this ridiculous theory, ""scientists"" systematically refuse to answer even the most basic questions about their political cult beliefs, and we should most definitely not undertake any action on the basis of crackpot theories that can't stand up to basic logic.

There is no scientific reason to believe the climate is unnatural, that humans are causing climate change, or that humans are causing disastrous climate change that can magically only be solved by a dictatorial state that exactly implements a UN wishlist of sustainability measures which predates all the ""established"" climate science and even the term ""climate change"" itself. 

The good news is that this entire doomsday cult will disappear once we start systematically sueing fraudulent ""scientists"" who misappropriate public funds to promote political ""only communism can save the planet!"" nonsense. As the Michael Mann court case proves.

This post also vastly misunderstands how net worth works. Stocks and investments aren't cash. Many billionaires/millionaires hold the vast majority of their wealth in illiquid assets, meaning they can't spend that money unless they sell. Which they don't want to do if they derive their income from dividends and capital gains on those assets.

So no. They could not ""blow a million dollars for 284827 years"", because that means selling their capital, from which they derive income, and that would be financial suicide.

Also, in a free market that isn't corrupted by government intervention, billionaires would only make a profit by investing in things that are popular among consumers and therefore serve some societal purpose. So, if a billionaire holds one billion in Facebook stock, it would be because Facebook is something that the public wants. In other words, he is sacrificing the opportunity to spend that billion dollars by putting it to work for the public who now get a billion dollars' worth of free Facebook services.

You can compare investing to paying taxes, except vastly more ethical and with an actual potential to do good: the billionaire ""pays"" a billion to Facebook by buying stock. If Facebook actually delivers something people want, he gets a cut of the profits and everyone benefits. If Facebook doesn't deliver, he can sell his shares and invest in a competitor.

So no. Billionaires don't keep billions of dollars in their checking accounts like total idiots. Most of their money is managed by other people and put to work for companies that actually provide value and therefore profit.

What do you recomend

Solution: Post-capitalism.

&#x200B;

If no one brings this up as a solution or work towards this solution, then I don't want to hear it.

stop this alarmist bs, no such thing as man made climate change. Do some research. It's all commie propaganda.

It’s not about future being grim or even the bs with everything that seems “normal” to us because we haven’t read or gained knowledge the people believing they run the world do. However, we’re living out a story that’s been developed for mankind and now we’re going to be experiencing the ending. Get in touch with your soul and know we all will be brought back again and judged for whatever was done in our life in this vestibule. It is meant for this to happen and it has been written when men believe they are gods themselves, there will be history as proof to what happens.

And of course - when I click on your profile it comes up as NSFW.  Good job reddit -  ridiculous!

Give some concrete dates and concrete predictions - ideally soon, so we can check your predictions. Otherwise I have a feeling you'll be back every 5 years claiming the sky is falling - and conveniently forget what you said 5, 10, 20, 50 years ago...

Read Steven Pinker's book 'Enlightenment Now', he calmly destroys much of your narrative. The free market - the greatest invention of man - will solve many of these issues automatically, for example. As resources become more scarce the price increases and the free market means alternatives are found - we've never run out of any resource EVER. The free market again sees to that.

Inequality isn't an issue. Absolute poverty is, and that has been in steep decline due to free market capitalism. Who is better off - a dirt poor gun living next to 10 other dirty poor guys in huts, or a middle class american living next to 8 other middle class Americans and 2 mansions? Pretty obvious.

Automation is 'grim'. Yes if you assume most people want to do crppy jobs. But they don't. UBI is inevitable.

Population - as countries become more rich, as they are doing - populations stabilize. Pretty easy one to tick off here bro. Again, thanks to free market capitalism.

I know you probably have a huge sunk cost in these causes and that you mean well. But I'm afraid it's all been a waste of time, there's nothing to worry about sorry. Still, I'm sure you've had some good fun inconveniencing people who actually have jobs and contribute to society in creative new ways over the years. Best of luck :D

I'm enjoying the present - the most prosperous time in human history with the least poverty and best educated people in history. I look forward to an even more amazing future. See you there - just don't forget some concrete predictions for 5, 10, and 30 years out say. Just so you can prove us wrong LOL.

First, it took me not even half of his arguments to assume obsession is a trace in his personality. Like  the typical IR, he does not focus on anything. Instead, he seeks arguments from many sources to compile an apocalyptic theory. I can relate because I too graduated on IR.

 Because many of these so called “new trends"" are tied to the political agenda, every once in a while society elects alarming agents to represent futurism thinking, like internationalists or even Greta Thunberg. Of course we should all reconsider the way we interact with non-renewable goods. But first we have to distinguish true and hoax, misinformation and disinformation. 

 Had he been more restrained in his arguments, he would have addressed neocapitalism, the convergence of technologies, and other phenomena that are clearly positive. He is clearly paranoid or has some intention, most likely the first.  

We have had mass extinction due to abrupt temperature fluctuations in the past, we continue here nevertheless. Earth is not a single organism that ""dies"", just like cells cannot die from one single defective organelle without adapting and reestructuring its DNA in time. A similar principle adapts to all life form. 

Furthermore, our planet has several biomes coexisting with tremendously different conditions.  Needless to say, in the technological phase we are in, there are many tools, not only to circumvent these situations, but also to capitalize on them, which brings me to my next argument.

The reason many have not yet embraced the eco war is mainly because capitalization on the consumption of non-renewable goods still is much higher. When the rates he refers to actually happen and rise, demand will force neocapitalists to offer new products and solutions.

An example is what has been going on with the fashion and makeup industry, not on decades, but during the last years. The demand for sustainable products has been spawned like a flu epidemy by massive hysterical millenials on social media.

Very soon we will have some “trends” for the unscrupulous avocado consumption, promoted by Californians. And believe it or not, it will be just another product very well disguised as a “solution”.

I would particularly say not to abandon religious reflection at all because it is through Christian communion, Catholic pragmatism, and Buddhist feedback that the new collective unconsciousness is generated for these changes. And we know that the greatest leaders are always religious. We know that those most interested in new treatments and therapies are the wealthiest such as Lady Gaga, who will probably rock the world against fibromyalgia.

Undoubtedly, out civilization is driven by catharses and inconsistencies. Graphics and futurology could not predict the acceleration of many phenomena, the downsizing, the revival of the analog technology.

And if even the great Einstein was wrong, why should we stick to mass hysteria, manipulative journalism in a permissive democracy?

Climatologists often emphasize that we need action rather than reflection. It is the exact opposite.  Action without reflection is like killing a predatory bird population simply because it threatens the local bird.  Yes, biomes are adaptive organisms. If one species perishes, another survives and strengthens itself.

To conclude, in order to become valid, his hypothesis of human mass extinction would have to be based on factors other than meat consumption and climate variation. Otherwise, the internationalist's analysis is very biased and even immature.

I'm sure you're aware of Andrew Yang, US presidential candidate. What do you think of him and his policies in relation to these issues? He talks a lot about automation and restructuring our economy especially.

  You're noting some converging trends i've been speaking about for years. But you're also overlaying your forecast with what you're wanting to see more than  a little bit too. It's a sin ubiquitous and uniquely pernicious to our breed, especially at first. Casting shapes we expect to see on the blank wall of the future.   


  But you're close. Closer than most. But you're still too personally emotionally invested to achieve a relatively uncluttered overview just yet. You're letting a lot of narrative emotional and political baggage poison your dataset, staining your results via a more subtle process of cognitive dissonance.   


  Get in contact when you're ready. Took me over a decade to learn how to (mostly) deactivate my expectation filters long enough to render better forecasting projections.

Wow, that is pretty interesting.

Seriously what can anyone do... Before things really gets rough where you happen to live, many things unpredictable things can happen in your region, country and globally. When we really go full into apocalypse mode it's only a matter of time before bandits/hungry people show up at your doorstep with guns.

American Midwest, arguably the Northwest are probably best positioned to weather things.  Northeast is looking at issues with it's water usage and total population count (remember, 1/3 of the US is in the strip from Northern Virginia to Boston)  


Not to say it'll be great, but those are probably the best places in the US.

This is a bit conservative, but provides a good general overview.

> I think the point is population reduction is the only viable long term solution. Massive massive massive reduction.

There seems to be confusion on this issue. I see a lot of misanthropic ^((also racist)^) bullshit on /r/overpopulation.

The question is not whether or not the population needs to be reduced. The population *will* experience a sharp decline; the question is how suddenly and whether we direct it or whether it's something that happens to us.

Wars’ a comin.

Malthusian nonsense. The problem isnt that there are too many people, the problem is that certain rich industrialised counties have gotten bloated on stealing the wealth and resources from the global South. 

What needs to happen is massive massive decrease in energy consumption in the US.

Nuclear is certainly not a solution for seismically active zones.  For sunkissed & windy places, solar & wind power is the solution.  Here is Australia, [government rebated solar panels](https://www.ipromiseaustralia.com.au/residential-solar-solutions/) offers a viable alternative to nuclear.

The problem is massively bad events do happen, and there are people that do warn they are coming. People warned of fascism before Hitler came to power, people warned of the 2007 wall street crash, hell the US government was warned of an imminent terrorist attack in the week leading up to 9/11. 

Most of those people were thought of as doom mongers too I'm sure. No one wants to believe anything bad can ever happen. Sometimes it does. 

That said there are plenty of paranoid nutters out there though, I feel you on that.

That's not what OP argued for, OR what I argued against.

Another made-up notion. Not sure why you responded to me -- you should just have a conversation where you reply to yourself.

Anyway, if you're troubled, please find someone to talk to who doesn't just tell you all your fears are completely justified. That's the danger of echo chambers.

1985-1999 was probably a better time than we are in now, but I think the best years were 1996-1999. I remember the Cold War and backlash from the Reagan recession in the late 80s early 90s, so I don’t believe it was all good then. 

Now we are heading towards a definitive social and societal collapse. I highly doubt after waiting so long to do anything that we can stop this issue. It seems like as time goes on it will just get worse and worse until we have a major wipe out of the human race. 

Oh well, it was fun while it lasted.

Yes but when I tell people that they think it’s nostalgia which is clearly bullshit.

If there is a raging epidemic of loneliness (even though I saw an article about it in 1997 as well) and people are behind screens and not using technology judiciously, is anyone surprised at the way society is heading?

Yes, indeed there was. I'd spent a decade using my twitter feed as my predictive gold standard. Anybody could view it, anything I forecast was time stamped. About as close to engraved in stone as one could get in the digital age.  Then, twitter in it's infinite wisdom decided to permaban my account when I confronted Tom Sutton about actively agitpropping for a second civil war among the RNC faithful on october the second of this year. 

 Twitter evaporated ten years of cumulative speculation, forecastings, eminence grise speculations, military/geopol OSINT ,  random conjecture, idle thoughts...And the vast bulk of my working hypothesis, & supportive citations/references with a keystroke.  

Considering how much of that i'd planned to reference in my upcoming book i'm writing, 'pissed off' doesn't even begin to describe how angry i am with them at this time.

Current atmospheric CO2 concentrations have already delayed the next ice age by 50 thousand years.

Watch out, we got a big brain hot take right here.

Looking forward to seeing your post with references and analysis. Oh, you're just an idiot? Fuck off.

Reality has a well known leftist bias. You should go stick your head in the sand and chant ""everything will be alright"".

[Good job posting this to your shitty little sub ](https://np.reddit.com/r/Shitstatistssay/comments/e8gzf7/reality_has_a_wellknown_liberal_bias/)

Your mom will probably be really proud of you.

Why did this get downvoted? This post is just smearing the right anyways.

>""Why the current economic system is broken:""

I'm too lazy to work!! so we need communism so nobody can flex with their money because i didnt decide to work, so i need gov to babysit me!!!!!111!

omg we need illgl aliens to save us!!! those great doctors and engineers coming to make our lives easier.

Yes they did - after the effect if interpreted in a certain way ignoring the hiatus that you pretend didn't happen - on a full moon.

Concrete claims. The earth was supposed to be on fire now, it isn't.

For everybody who warns of a bad thing that will happen, there's others who warned about something that never happened - often the same people. It's confirmation bias on steroids.

Well put.

I can't thank you enough for that information.

Late reply, but we need more stores that would buy waste and resell them for cheap. There are ""sell-by date"" stores that sell ""expired"" foods that are still fresh for so fucking cheap, for example.

This is something I just worked out for myself but...

The thing about petroleum based fuels is that they're essential to run a military and militaries are essential to keep political power functioning. But petrol doesn't keep, it degrades. So you need to have constant production.

Production of fuel means sifting out all the long chain hydrocarbons. It's a waste product, but it's also a very useful waste product. You can't just dump it all- there's too much of it. So they find uses for it, like wrapping everything they can with it (plastic packaging) and smearing it all over the ground (bitumen roads). You have to make sure that you produce more than you need of aviation and ground vehicle fuel, and we get to use the rest that's leftover (this avoids shortfall). Mass production of consumer products pacifies the population and also gets workers where they need to go. It also feeds the workforce (you can't have a military without workers, and the point of political power is to keep the poor working for the rich.)

So the system is dependent on oil and we're plugged into it. On the other hand, it isn't a system that benefits is. The system needs us, and cares for us to the extent that it's necessary to sustain itself, but we don't need it.

The collapse of this system will be bad for everyone if we don't prepare for it, and we aren't prepared. But it's a bad system and it needs to collapse, and it will, the sooner the better.

How do we ensure socialism doesn't fail and turn into an oppressive regime?

Steven Pinker is a glorified cheerleader for the capitalist class.  Also he was buddy buddy with Jeffery Epstein.  Fuck that guy.

Depends on whether civilians are intentionally targeted or not.  

One battalion of soldiers can pretty easily take, hold, and execute everyone in a small city if the people are unarmed.  Then move on to the next one and so on.

Not really, no. But those saying ""no more illegal immegrants!"" Aren't at all concerned about an economic underclass. They are looking for a scapegoat: ""they're taking your jobs"" etc

How exactly is superstition supposed to help???

Lol I wish you see a psychologist to deal with your childish delusions or traumatic indoctrination. 

This is a discussion about science. We will welcome you with open arms  when you are ready to deal with observable and falsifiable reality.

If you used an online platform like twitter to collate important research with no backups then you aren't as smart as you'd like us to believe.

Neat they’ll balance out into a humid day-glow hellscape.

General term for those that thought Stalin and Mao were good leaders that did the right thing. Basically heavily authoritarian ""left""

Apologists for the worst things that allegedly ""communist"" parties do- named for the members of the communist party of Great Britain who would defend the defeat of revolts in Hungary and Czechoslovakia by tank regiments sent by the USSR.

If I don't understand it, then it's leftist propaganda. It's simple really.

Nature always does want to revert to a state of constant change so I can give that to you if that's what you mean.

Isn’t destroying the planet pretty much the definition of an economy that doesn’t function ?

You are also very confused, leftists generally don’t like the owner class who make money not by actually working but by owning and taking the surplus value of the labour of workers.

>Concrete claims. The earth was supposed to be on fire now, it isn't.

Said who?

Yeah errr, have you heard of Australia bro? 

We are literally on fucking fire down here. Our biggest city Sydney is chocking on bushfire smoke. 

2 million hectares of bush has been burnt in the last couple of months, and we aren't even in our proper bushfire season yet.

Yeah. In this case, I'm not going to pretend to know enough about science and the accuracy of this *particular* field of study, to live my life assuming a Mad Max style future is round the corner. 

I'll assume it's possible, but just as well we could find ways to deal with it all the issues of climate change arise. Who could know for sure.

I wish I could give you an award. Have you read the deep adaptation paper? There's a seed of hope there.

Thankfully, for the US Navy at least, there's [technology that exists for synthesizing jet fuel from sea water](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/fuel-seawater-whats-catch-180953623/) (since CO2 is dissolved in there). Seeing as their carriers are all powered by fission plants, getting the energy needed for the process is already there.

Vote harder.

You can’t.  And here’s why:

Under socialism the government (supposedly the people, but that’s never the case) own the means of production.  You can go on like this for a while.  Every person doing their job, and getting their monthly stipend from the government, until one day, someone comes up with a new idea, or invents a new product.  

Now, people want this product, so this theoretical inventor starts making and selling them on the side of his job for extra money.  

Soon, he realizes that he can make more money selling these new widgets than he can working at the state factory, so he quietly quits and starts a widget business.  Still the orders are pouring in, and he’s making money hand over fist, but he’s working 16 hour days 7 days per week.  So he decides to hire some help from the local factory he used to work for.  He tells them that he’ll pay them 10% more than the factory is if they’ll make widgets for him instead of the gulag inspired wall hangings they’ve been making for the government.  They look at the easier work, and the higher pay, and say “SURE THING NEW BOSS!”  

Now has been created the first capitalist.  

The socialist government has a few options: 

1. Let the man profit off the product that he alone invented and disband the notion of state ownership of the means of production completely.  
>this is the only morally justifiable course of action, I.e. capitalism.  

2. Take the factory from him forcefully, and make the man go back to work at the gulag while the state decides who gets cushy new jobs at the widget factory (fun fact: it’ll be those in the “inner party” or their children)
>this is the option most often chosen by socialist regimes, and makes it authoritarian by nature

3. Shut down the factory, and execute the man for the audacity of going against state socialism 
>this is what happens when the proles start to see how much better the capitalist had it before the government came in and stole his idea and his factory. 

So there you go.  You can have socialism as long as all innovation is owned by the government and it’s impossible to have a “side gig” because eventually someone’s side gig will be more lucrative than working at the recycled used toilet paper factory and then everyone else will see how much better off they are as capitalists rather than socialists and the whole rotten idea collapses.  Generally governments don’t like it when it’s proven that their entire method of governing and economic organization is morally indefensible, blatantly short sighted, and violent, so they crack down on non-socialists.  Bam: authoritarianism.

Constitutional requirements and a return of the media fairness act to force news to give both sides of s story(accurately) and criminalize political hate speech that divides the people. This all can be accomplished through regulations. The major hurdle is that those in power or with the money will drive the working class to ditch the system in favor of their's. Those that try to deceptively divide our country by using hate should be thrown in jail. There are many ways to create a just society but those come with losing some freedoms.

Not persuaded. Are you actually able to find fault with any of his assertions?

Thank you sir, I see anger is swift in you and your defense picks up when sensitive subjects arise. Maybe you require the same therapy you referred?

It didn't start out with that purpose. It began it's life as my shop twitter to shoot out updates to my customer base. But when I retired it shifted over to forecasting, staying in contact with my OSINT peeps, and politics.  Just ended working well around everything else i had going on. If you wish, you can catch snapshots by using the internet wayback machine. Twitter account name was ""@dontfearrepair"". Among some of my more standout moments included calling the 2016 US election two weeks early. The active measure interference from the Russian IRA as far back as 2015. Beating the rest of the predictive pack by nearly two years by accurately guessing from a sparse field of clues that the russians were interfering in the US GPS relays starting in 2017...Just for starters. 

  I know this is the internet, and every tom dickless and hairy talks out of their butts...But i'm not. Nor is it a matter of smarts, though that doesn't hurt things. It takes a special types of intelligence, with a ravenous curiosity about anything and everything. But it only comes into it's own when you mature enough emotionally to be able to step outside of your own headspace temporarily, and try someone elses on.

Sounds like something from a cyberpunk novel.

gottit - thanks

thanks - makes sense now

They've tried to cover it up but go back and find news reports about global warming in the 90s, see what it says is supposed to be happening now.

I've learned that alarmist don't see the fraud or they don't care.

I've learned they don't read and have no comprehension skills, either.

Like every continent besides Antarctica has had crazy record breaking fires or large fires in general in the last few years. California. Greece. The Amazon Rainforest. Australia. Plus many more. Yes some of these were started artificially but the condition of things led to its burnability.

Never heard of it.

It's a matter of financial efficiency.

Poe's law in full effect.

So don't do state communism, put the factory IN THE HANDS OF THE WORKERS.

I ask you how we prevent oppression and you advocate for censorship? That's usually the first step to tyranny. 

I agree with the media fairness act, its roll back has all but ruined news, and I would be interested to hear what constitutional requirements you think are necessary.

Are you really in favor of criminalizing free speech?  Are you that short sighted?

Just because a superstition has a rich tradition or is a deeply held center of someone’s world perspective that doesn’t categorically change it.

Your proselytizing is an act of aggression

I think i understand, to some degree, what you are talking about. I would be very interested to read about your take on the matter.

So you steal the mans intellectual property and put him on the same level as the mongoloid worker who couldn’t come up with a new invention because he had the terrible misfortune of living under a government that people like you support?

Censorship of the media is needed and our ravenous partisan society today is a direct result of the lack of limited censorship (political hate speech to divide us) on the media. Do you want total freedom? This country has shown what that gives us in the form of near-monthly domestic terrorism attacks(gun rights), the over-powering elite oligarchy that steals our money, religious legal rights in that allow for discrimination, and the indoctrination of the masses from news media outlets (mainly Fox News) that makes us hate each other.

Thank u for ur replies and this info...

Uh i got 1 pressing question. How much do u think itll cost. for everything. to get housing, stock up and stockpile food and supplies and shyt

I think I'm going to spend the time and work up a completely non-hostile in intent counterpoint to his main subject points. Partially to illustrate my point, partially to offer a more rounded picture of the probability projections.  The base problem with all futurist projections comes down to those projections telling you a vast amount about the author yet almost nothing on the subject. Yes, even including me!  Mine just involves a few extra editorial reviews. We're deductive logicians, not psychics after all.

One quick caveat though. I am of the very strong opinion that at least one great fermi filter lies ahead of us, with a solid dozen or so firmly behind us. As the original writer notes, as I had myself back in the early 2000's that when you start overlaying multiple disciplines risk projections you start noticing all the lines starting to converge in the 2060's, and fully overlapping by 2085. I do not see a likely survival path for our species that doesn't involve tremendous upheaval and catastrophic loss of life. Humans have been sprinting at a mirror for ten thousand years now. In the next hundred, hundred and fifty we find out whether we break the mirror...Or that mirror breaks us.

We could celebrate the mans invention and reward him to a degree based on positive impacts without strictly going off sales revenue. Also as soon as you consider people mongoloids you loss any respect for whatever thought you are trying to support. Be respectful.

You're creating absolutes from a nuanced scenario. I'm also not sure what guns have to do with censorship. Overpowered oligarchies are the result of both corporate interest and government power without oversight, and giving more power to one of those wont fix the problem. 

The problem with censorship is that ""hate speech"" quickly becomes ""people I disagree with,"" see your fox news comment.

 I find this interesting. Supposedly Isaac Newton predicted the world to end in 2060. I know probably not logical to think of eschatology and all of that but still.

I'm optimistic about our future to be honest. I'm hoping we can figure out ways to create space colonies and, quite frankly I think capitalism will lead the way for that. Anyway your posts were interesting to read. I started following you account on here if that's alright.

First, Mongoloid is an old [technical term](https://www.britannica.com/science/Down-syndrome ) for a person with trisomy-21AKA DOWNS.  The Point is socialism reduces people to their lowest common denominator. Since people are not equal in ability or intellect, this can only be achieved through authoritarianism.  

Second, rewarding the inventor without the reward being tied to the sales revenue of the invention isn’t in any way fair or appropriate to either the people (if the reward is too high) or to the inventor (if the reward is too low) .  Only allowing the owner to profit off his invention is fair to everyone involved.  

The government gives you an extra helping of gruel for the next month, while they make billions off your invention and intellect... sounds just Like something a socialist would promote.

I absolutely agree and that is why the regulations for what constitutes hate speech would be lengthy. It would be challenging to create a perfect system, but it is a challenge that needs to be taken up. We do not know what is real or sensationalized news if not outright lies anymore in general. We also a being told to be mad as hell and that the other side is the problem with this country. The problem is essentially that both sides won't share(no making concessions anymore) just like little kids.

My god damn... gonna be really hard

I may sound a little old fashioned by saying it, but I personally favor a ""hope for the best, plan for the worst"" strategy. In a forecast projection you shouldn't emotionally invest in any outcome during your prelude stage or you're just biasing your conclusions right out of the gate. Most futurists fall into this trap, until they cognitive bias themselves into full cynic or pollyanna. Both poles have a...certain gravity? all their own.

As for capitalism, I have found an allegory in recent years that sumises my studied feelings towards it. Commerce is a fire that drives innovation, yes. It's also a fire that destroys everything it touches. So, we must govern commerce, and capitalism in a very similar way as we do fire....It's only useful when it's capacity for harm is mitigated. It's power properly understood and respected. 
  A fire in a forge means a busy blacksmith, producing everything everyone else needs to do anything they'd really want to do in the first place. A fire in the village means people without homes, people dead, injured, and suffering.  Livelihoods wrecked, beyond repair in some cases. Relationships and communities irrevocably ruined or destroyed. 

 It is my firm opinion & observation that humankind has yet to properly appreciate, understand, or appropriately manage the two types of power that also represent it's greatest existential threats. Both could easily end all human life in a matter of days, weeks, or years. Worse than nuclear fission. Worse than biological weapons. But we live with both daily, and have come to hold a dangerously cavalier attitude towards them. Familiarity breeding a suicidal contempt. Mistaken mythologies in place of 
factual understanding. Belief that we actually understand what's going on 'under the hood', so to speak. 

Those two forms of power are economic, and political.

Yikes man, you really love to put words in my mouth to make some convoluted point. Maybe consider the problem OP posted about and look for solutions instead of making up some sort of narrative for whatever topis you are looking to preach about it.

I think you’re observation is 100% accurate, I just don’t know that an attempt at regulating speech is the best way to fix it. Historically speaking that’s a dangerous road to travel, though to be honest I can’t come up with another solution.

This is true. Its not going to be an easy future but I don't think it will be as people say. Hope for the best etc. is a good strategy.

😳

So from what I understand here you are for more classic regulated capitalism rather than laissez-faire or complete anarcho-capitalism? I can agree with that. I go to the an-cap subs because they are much more open to debate than an-coms but I am regular capitalist person. If I'm way off that's fine too.

> New Zealand’s government banned foreigners from buying homes, with the restrictions set to take effect in coming months.

.............fuck

I'm not sure I have the appropriate depth of study, the scope of knowledge to define much more than a legalistic or policy outline. I can make suggestions for guidelines, but I lack the appropriate education to mandate details. I can only lend something to it's spirit, not it's substance as it were. I pride myself on knowing where the sidewalk ends on my personal insight. lol
But we need to instil some drastic changes to how we manage and emotionally relate to these systems if we mean to preserve human life, dignity, and longevity. That much is abundantly clear to even the meanest of intelligences.

Perhaps we might sideline and discuss such pertinent details? I'll freely admit i'm at about a third year economics major level of understanding, and i'm always keen to deepen what i know. :D

But as a side note, I feel that the Austrian School of economic thought is just as imperially flavored as it is flawed. It reeks of railroad baron preconceptions, and manifest destiny excesses. Just as fundamentally at odds with human nature as anything Marx ever dreamed up. 
  It is my observation that the likely road ahead lies not in remaining married to specific schools of thought, but rather to start picking and choosing among all available known ones to refine a 'best practices' guide that pulls together a practical application of the best ideas among all of them.

deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.3313  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/85432)

Eh fair enough.

Sure. I'm not really an expert. In fact you probably know a lot more than I do. I guess I look at things in the more layman's way. I don't know much about the different schools of economic thought. I've heard of the Keynesian and Austrian schools of thought but I haven't looked into either very much. 

I don't think capitalism itself is at odds with human nature. It seems that human nature brought forth capitalism. As humans created more and more complex societies and cultures ne economic systems developed. It seems to me that one difference between Marxism and capitalism is that capitalism naturally evolved over time out of necessity for a fair exchange of goods and services while Marxism was created. I liken communism to a factory farm where the animal is caged up in something that only slightly resembles its habitat and expected to produce whereas capitalism is more like an ecosystem complete with herbivores, carnivores and scavengers. Unlike the factory farm where animals are cramped and slowly dying in cages, the animals compete with each other and are able to produce healthy and better products for our consumption.

>It reeks of railroad baron preconceptions, and manifest destiny excesses. 

I could see this but there are or there were laws and policies put in place in order to reign in the boss tweeds of the country. The regulations in my opinion should be like the fence around the nature preserve. Big enough for the ecosystem to be protected and wide enough to not have to worry about interference. Unfortunately it seems that Google, big tech companies, large corporations and such have found ways around it. It seems like someone from outside the ecosystem has been feeding their favored animals to the point where they have grown too big for the habitat.

On the more individual level its agreements between people. I agree to work this amount of hours if the company or employer gives me this amount of pay. I want this item, this person agrees to give this item for an amount I pay. Supply and demand work for both products and services as well as labor.

Of course, as I've said, I'm not an expert on all this. This is just going by what I've experienced in my life and what I have observed. By the way tagging along and helping out a resaler is one of the things that helped me realize the economy is more of an ecosystem. The guy I worked with went to estate sales. After a particularly big haul of buying books, games, DVDs, CDs, and so on, he laid out his entire haul on a table and compared it to bringing home a freshly hunted carcass. The sale we went to was of a bigger, more successful resaler. It made me think. There are three types of people in the economic ecosystem. Herbivores (the people who work the day job and consume products available. If they get far and become large its due to hard work and diligence in saving money), carnivores (the ones willing to risk capital to start their own business or invest in another's and basically create the ""plants"" herbivores consume) and the scavengers (the people like my neighbor who goes to the estate sales and picks the carcass clean in order to use and generate his own wealth).

> It is my observation that the likely road ahead lies not in remaining married to specific schools of thought, but rather to start picking and choosing among all available known ones to refine a 'best practices' guide that pulls together a practical application of the best ideas among all of them.

I have the feeling many people do this anyway. At least the ones who discuss about it and know a lot more. I don't really know.

BTW: A lot of this i'm working into a book as i'd previously mentioned. My goal is to bring to politics and economics what Kahlil Gibran did for christianity, and western faith in general. 
...If you've ever read ""the prophet"" that is.

Your allegory of Marxist to farming practices is a good one. The parallels are direct and damning as Lysenkoism itself was. I knew a few fellas back in the day that actually lived through the holodomor. Were there for it. Barely survived it when many of their relatives and loved ones didn't. I hardly blame Ukraine for wishing to keep Moscow at arms length. Moscow has a troubled history there, AT BEST, and much to account for though it never shall. Moscow just regards it as their territorial divine right, to ravage or despoil as they see fit on a whim. 

 Your allegory of capitalism as a ecosystem is also quite accurate. The principle point of failure, as I see it, is directly attributable to what's described as 'no limits capitalism', which is more destructive even than it sounds...Which is saying something. It is also the prevailing view that shapes the modern derivative practice of the austrian school of economic thought.  Our entire damned economic and banking system is still substantially sistered to it. Utterly platformed on it. Will not accept limitations to it's self-professed exceptionalism to it all.  Like an ecosystem you've likened to, it can course correct only from single catastrophic points of failure. Which is what we've been lucky enough to dodge the bullet on...so far. Though an argument can be made the  '28 crash and dustbowl having some double hitter overlap. But it's a probabilistic inevitably that eventually those dice will roll snake eyes at some point. Prudence demanding we treat it as happening sooner as opposed to later. We take a one-two punch, we will likely to be sunk by it...With international power players wanting our asses off the geopol centerstage egging it on. Whatever emerges from the ruins will hardly resemble anything we'd recognize, and will be driven by survival ethics alone. All of our principled ideals flushed with the baby in the bathwater of a failed state. 

 I am of the strong opinion that we can mitigate, or harm reduce by not allowing any single or collective discreet entities allowances of scale or influence in which they can exploit tweedist leveraging of the system itself to protect their myopic interests far and beyond the general welfare of the   public itself. Anything of great enough scale gets public oversight with a lot of uncomfortable spotlighting, period. Either that, or they statitorially surrender gains harvested by the general public to keep below cap threshold. 
 Nobody has yet to advance a sufficient justification(though Elon Musk, and J.P. Morgan comes close) to justify why we continue to indulge a hyper predatory domination of billionaires to drive our broader policy decisions, and privately sole determine our collective public predestination. Almost without fail, they all create well provisioned private universes the rest of us aren't welcome to participate in, except in the roles of servant or commodity chit. 
 Sorrynotsorry, but nobody NEEDS to be a fuck'n billionaire or collective company TRILLIONAIRE(apple). Most who do make it turn into complete self absorbed fuckstick bastards like Robert Mercer went(oh yeah you rotten fucker...We're still on your six. You thought we'd forget? I know you still run web crawlers hunting for name mentions from your Owl's Nest eyier. Run rabbit, run!). The few who don't fail to justify the leverageable systems continued existence. Like we're seeing with the climate debate, a very few self interested bastards with no detectable generational survival reflex can derail something that impacts our longer term survival and broader well being in a directly harmful way.

PS: sorry about the weird esoteric reference down the page a bit. I like periodically reminding a certain individual that not everyone's memory is short. That no matter where he runs, there's gonna be a set of handcuffs waiting for him and his prodigee daughter at some point soon enough.

That's interesting. I have The Prophet but have yet to read it. I really need to.

The Robert Mercer part? I honestly thought you were making references to *Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep*. Then I found that the book was talking about a Wilber Mercer. Either way its fine whatever. I'm going to type the response to the rest of the thing here if that's okay...

>But it's a probabilistic inevitably that eventually those dice will roll snake eyes at some point. Prudence demanding we treat it as happening sooner as opposed to later. We take a one-two punch, we will likely to be sunk by it...

Of course. This is the natural way of things. Empires rise. Empires fall. New ones emerge from the ashes.

>With international power players wanting our asses off the geopol centerstage egging it on. Whatever emerges from the ruins will hardly resemble anything we'd recognize, and will be driven by survival ethics alone.

I think the US becoming a regional power won't be too bad. [This guy seems to be saying its inevitable and that we seem to have a pretty good footing for it.](https://youtu.be/feU7HT0x_qU?t=1440). Whether or not countries like China or Russia try to mess with that is up for debate. The guy in the linked video shows a number of possible choke points people might exploit. I think if the US plays their cards right we should come out of it alright though.

Anything of great enough scale gets public oversight with a lot of uncomfortable spotlighting, period.

I'm not entirely sure about this. As I understand Peter Schiff (not related to the congressman as far as I know) talked about the way the government, being too big, has allowed lobbyists from corporations to buy influence. In [this](https://youtu.be/UGL-Ex1CD1c?t=382) part of the video he talks about what the role of government should be, as in the protection of life, liberty and property. He's basically one of those guys who think the markets can regulate themselves. I agree with him for the most part but I can see that the government should take a more referee type of role for business.

>nobody NEEDS to be a fuck'n billionaire or collective company TRILLIONAIRE(apple).

No. I guess not but it could also be argued that nobody needs to live in a big house, drive a car, own a TV or a computer. I mean the Amish have gotten along quite well for the past hundred years. I have learned that its better not to compare myself with other people. I mean I could care less if Jeff Bezos has a huge mansion, yacht and Olympic sized swimming pool with billions of cash. I feel like a lot of the underlying problems people have with the rich is some form of jealousy. At least some people have this. They see these people having more money than they have and they are probably thinking, ""where is mine?"" They scapegoat the rich and blame them or the faceless companies for the problems. Not defending them or anything and not saying they aren't the cause of some problems. Just saying its a bit more complicated than that. I'm a guy who goes to work, works hard and comes home to relax until the next day when I have to do it again.

> Most who do make it turn into complete self absorbed fuckstick bastards...

I guess I can see that. The people holding the university protests before the Trump election seemed to be pretty high up on the totem pole. I think one of the organizers at Missou had a father who owned a portion of Union Pacific and makes millions of dollars. Of course I think part of that is human nature. You get rich, make a few decisions and you, or your children later on, think they are morally superior because you or your family made the right decisions and you lived the privileged life. Its like the South Park episode where Kyle moves to California and everyone is smug about how progressive they all are.

>Like we're seeing with the climate debate

The climate debate is mostly political anyway. It seems others have similar opinion about this but, while I think the climate is changing, it isn't strictly because of human activity. The climate has been changing for millennia. We just came along and made it worse by putting more carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere than the environment can handle. I think even then there are probably solutions out there we can use without overhauling the entire economic system.

Reading The Prophet is on my list. I have other books I'm currently reading before it though.

I am an avowed atheist after looking hard at eight of nine world religions, and exploring several hundred(yes, literally) minor sects or philosophy over two decades or so. With all that being said, ""The Prophet"" is my go-to gift for anyone in my personal life going through a bereavement, or a 'dark time of the soul' to quote Luthor ...Whether they have any theology or not.  It is beautiful...It stirs and comforts something deep in the human psyche. But it should be savored slowly, like white tea or the Tao Te Ching. Downing it all in one go substantially removes full appreciation for it. Instead I strongly...STRONGLY suggest using each subsection as a foundation for a daily meditation for it's most ideal saturation. 
  And yes, you should go get it from your bookshelf right now and end your procrastination! 
  Yes. Now. Shoo!  Or you'll put it off again. ;)

I think you've a pretty fair grasp of things yourself and I do not think we are in substantive disagreement. Anything we do disagree about we also both admit is above our head and probably better left for better minds. lol

I kind of think their view is bullshit but I admit, I have trouble assessing their argument because I also find them to be just personally narcissistic and annoying. But it seems as though this perspective is popular. They've certainly had no trouble getting high-profile support.

Is objectivity *really* a myth? Is this a contested idea? Or is this person still pretty fringe and just gets attention for being super woke?

[Here's](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/V/bo29172094.html) a synopsis of the book.

""#MeToo. #BlackLivesMatter. #NeverAgain. #WontBeErased. Though both the right- and left-wing media claim “objectivity” in their reporting of these and other contentious issues, the American public has become increasingly cynical about truth, fact, and reality. In *The View from Somewhere*, Lewis Raven Wallace dives deep into the history of “objectivity” in journalism and how its been used to gatekeep and silence marginalized writers as far back as Ida B. Wells.  
   
At its core, this is a book about fierce journalists who have pursued truth and transparency and sometimes been punished for it—not just by tyrannical governments but by journalistic institutions themselves. He highlights the stories of journalists who question “objectivity” with sensitivity and passion: Desmond Cole of the *Toronto Star*; *New York Times* reporter Linda Greenhouse; Pulitzer Prize-winner Rachel Kaadzi Ghansah; Peabody-winning podcaster John Biewen; *Guardian* correspondent Gary Younge; former *Buzzfeed* reporter Meredith Talusan; and many others. Wallace also shares his own experiences as a midwestern transgender journalist and activist who was fired from his job as a national reporter for public radio for speaking out against “objectivity” in coverage of Trump and white supremacy.   
   
With insightful steps through history, Wallace stresses that journalists have never been mere passive observers—the choices they make reflect worldviews tinted by race, class, gender, and geography. He upholds the centrality of facts and the necessary discipline of verification but argues against the long-held standard of “objective” media coverage that asks journalists to claim they are without bias. Using historical and contemporary examples—from lynching in the nineteenth century to transgender issues in the twenty-first—Wallace offers a definitive critique of “objectivity” as a catchall for accurate journalism. He calls for the dismissal of this damaging mythology in order to confront the realities of institutional power, racism, and other forms of oppression and exploitation in the news industry.  
   
Now more than ever, journalism that resists extractive, exploitive, and tokenistic practices toward marginalized people isn’t just important—it is essential. Combining Wallace’s intellectual and emotional journey with the wisdom of others’ experiences, *The View from Somewhere* is a compelling rallying cry against journalist neutrality and for the validity of news told from distinctly subjective voices.""","AT BEST ""objectivity"" and ""neutrality"" are beautiful costumes which obscure what the reporters' real perspective and point of view and prejudices and biases and preferences really are.   I prefer transparency about fact-gatherers' ideologies.

There is no real ""objectivity"" or ""neutrality"" in any of us, and there never could be. 

The costumes are to maximize audience, a marketing tactic.   It's sad that we've forgotten that and have come to believe our own bullshit.

It's tough. I do think it's valid that it's harder for people to act and be seen as ""neutral"" when their very identities are contested — in this case as a trans person, or racialized people, etc. To take it back to earlier times: could an openly gay person ""objectively"" report on bathhouse raids? Should they be expected to? Fairness should certainly be strived for but objectivity, the view from nowhere, I think is certainly up for more debate.

Are you familiar with unconscious bias?

If honest journalism even exists, I'm not sure where to find it. I find journalists to be generally dishonest people who are more engaged in political narrative than reporting facts. This question poses: "" the American public has become increasingly cynical about truth, fact, and reality."" I don't find that to be the truth at all. The American public has become increasingly cynical about news organizations, largely because so many of them are caught in lies and omissions.

The perfect example came just this week when the Justice department revealed that 8 individuals, including George Nader, who is currently locked up on pedophile porn charges, were charged in a scheme to illegally funnel foreign money to Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign. (See: https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/california-ceo-and-seven-others-charged-multi-million-dollar-conduit-campaign-contribution) If this were Trump, it would be headline news, and reporters would be demanding answers from every one in Trump's orbit, including the president himself. Headlines about this scandal would be blaring all week long. 

Meanwhile, none of the sort has happened.  In fact, what did happen is none of the cable news channels covered this bombshell story about foreign influence in our elections. When the New York Times finally got around to coering the story a day later, the published it in the dead of the morning, and the photo for the story was a picture of Donald Trump standing next to George Nader. (See: https://i.imgur.com/ATDrqua.png)

I think journalism is committing suicide right now, and I'm personally glad to help it. This last story is a microcosm of why I voted for Trump. I know of no better way to drown our current media establishment in its bathtub and hope for something better to come and take its place. I was formerly Never Trump, but the wikileaks revelations about how in bed the media was with the Hillary Clinton campaign was a real wake up call. Subsequently, the official documents that were declassified about Operation Mockingbird, and the CIA's involvement in not just influencing but infiltrating our media made it clear that our media is battleground in a war with the public to control the narrative.

A clear example of this is the former ombudsman of the NYT wondering out loud in the Washington Post today about what journalists can do to build support for impeachment (see: https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/wall-to-wall-impeachment-coverage-is-not-changing-any-minds-heres-how-journalists-can-reach-the-undecided/2019/12/05/a04aa658-16c3-11ea-a659-7d69641c6ff7_story.html). There is so much wrong with this it's hard to know where to begin.

The bottom line for me is that our media, as it currently exists, is corrupt in a way that I've long suspected, but only became transparently clear when an outsider candidate not approved by the establishment estate that spans media, parties and corporations got into office. I don't know how it can ever be fixed, but I do know that as an individual I have no faith in the current structure, and cant even imagine a time when I could trust the media the same way I previously tried to again.

Maybe I'm an idiot but is it not possible for a gay person to just report the facts of what happened in the bathhouse raids and how it affected people? I mean sure they'd privately feel what they feel, but it sometimes feels akin to saying a lawyer can't defend a murderer if they don't murder. It's a job...?

This person seems to not just be saying journalists aren't objective, but that objectivity is a ruse that hurts protected identities. I feel like if journalism commits suicide and is replaced with something else, that something else would be... journalism done right. No?

I think it's an incredibly gray area. One of the problems is that ""objectivity"" and ""neutrality"" are often boiled down to ""here's what person A said, here's what person B said, both sides are equally valid"" when, of course, they often aren't. Jay Rosen has written a lot about the challenges for this style of journalism in the Trump era ([here, for example](http://pressthink.org/2018/06/its-time-for-the-press-to-suspend-normal-relations-with-the-trump-presidency/)) when you have someone who isn't playing by the normal rules of what ""truth"" is. 

If you're in a newsroom or environment that is willing to play by just-the-facts, it might be a little easier, but sometimes the facts are more controversial than the truth. You can already see what's happening to news outlets that try to play it down the middle, getting attacked on all sides as being partisan. It's also important to recognize that the idea of a neutral press is a relatively new concept of the mid-20th century, before that it was just assumed the paper you were reading had a viewpoint they were pushing.

There's also a question of being a passive observer is the morally right thing to do in the event of some great injustice. [This is a good piece examining that](https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-moral-failings-of-american-press-coverage-of-nazi-germany). It might be easy for people not in marginalized groups to see it as simple to keep your views to yourself and report on events, but if your very personhood is under assault by a mainstream of society, or up for debate, I can certainly understand how you might feel compelled to abandon that quest.

A gay reporter might be the the victim of the raid, either directly by being patron at the raided establishment, or secondarily knowing those who are victimized by police and/or sympathizing with them, maybe very deeply.  The indignity of being forced to appear ""neutral"" when it's your own community under attack is pretty, ahem, gross and twisted.   Try it some time yourself and tell me how it feels.

One would hope, but at the end of the day a journalist has to eat, and it would seem that the entity with the checkbook will always have the ability to promote or stifle the facts that they have preference to.

There's one more criticism that I'd offer and this one is fairly controversial. I read a bit of the background if the person in question. They are clearly biased, aggressively even. Fair enough.

They go on about ""post-fact"" world and ""alternative facts."" They also speak a lot about being transgendered. 

If I could talk to this person, I'd ask them one question. I would ask this question: Which is the alternative fact: that you are a female, or that you are a male?

This would not be to persecute them, but rather to demonstrate the crossroads that we are at in our society right now. The answer to this question is profoundly individualistic and reveals a vast ocean in understanding of what a fact even is today.

Indeed, Jay Rosen has been talking about this problem since the George W. Bush administration.  It's  not a Trump-specific problem.  Back during the highly polarizing Iraq War, we coined a phrase ""the reality based community"" as a contrast/critique of the pro-war faction that had pushed so many alternative facts it would make Kellyanne Conway's head spin. And those lies had a huge body count.

I'm not sure I completely agree about it being twisted if you have a sense of duty or beliefs beyond yourself. But if it was so bad, theoretically, recuse yourself and another reporter could do it. It's still neutral to report rigorously on the gay people being brutalized, and it would be as well to report on a long trend of police being horrible. Neutral doesn't mean we can't make anyone mad

>if you have a sense of duty or beliefs beyond yourself

you're assuming this is a big story that will get done one way or another, whomever may be assigned to it.  But often people from marginalized communities are aware of stories, have sources for stories, or a passion for stories, that are *not* shared by others in the newsroom.  That's pretty dang frequent, actually.  So you're marginalizing your own news product and re-marginalizing an already marginalized community if you say members of that community ought to recuse themselves from covering their community--like, that's where many of your sources are, so.....  And your response would be that they don't have to recuse themselves so long as they can pretend to be neutral.  And I think that's twisted and re-marginalizes the reporter, their community and the news product itself, actually--because you're forgoing valuable information in favor of a costume.

When I’m at work I’m staring at a screen. When I’m not at work I’m staring at screens. Checking social media. Scrolling through updates. Scrolling through friends. Scrolling through products. Scrolling through #instagram. Scrolling through #amazon. Products make me happy. The customer is always right. Make sure that what you’re selling is something that people want to buy.


On the subway we’re surrounded by people that we don’t know. People we’ll never see again. Our heads are tilted down, eyes connected to smartphones and pod devices. Playing free games. Bright lights and colorful shapes. We stare into our screens.  Our screens stare into us.  Swipe swipe swipe. #whatsapp group texts. #netflix. Fantasy football updates. #snapchats. The anxiety of being human. New Yorkers avoid looking at or talking to one another. Once in a while there will be a crazy person on the train and all of us normal passengers can smile at each other and sigh. At least we’re not crazy.


If you close your eyes the movement of the subway feels organic, as if the trains and underground tunnels are alive. The subway tunnels are the arteries and veins of the city, the passageways of the busy hive. A buzz of worker bees on our way. Where are we going?


I don’t want be a part of the hive. But I’m a human being. I need other human beings.


Something is broken in me. I hate myself. I don’t feel a sense of belonging or connection in any aspect of my life. friendships, family, romance, work. Ennui and alienation are my reality. A city of 8 million people. A hive of loneliness.


My life is no tragedy. There are no readily apparent causes for the dissatisfaction I feel. I wasn’t abused. I went to college. I had all the benefits of a middle class upbringing. I’m a white male in a society that has persecuted anyone and everyone who isn’t.
There was a terrorist attack and the nation was in shock. A maniac with a gun shot up a shopping mall. The president offered his condolences. We had an all-staff call at work to discuss how we felt. It’s important for us to remember that terrorists are evil. When terrible things happen on our TV screens it’s important to show solidarity.


We’ve never had an all-staff call at work to discuss our solidarity with the homeless people that we walk by each day between the subway station and our office. The woman who stands by the subway entrance shaking her cup of change every day. The couple that sleep in sleeping bags each night under the awning of the bodega. There was no all-staff call to discuss our solidarity with our co-workers who were laid off last week.


I eat mostly fast food. Food should be fast.  Life is fast.  Fast. Food. Chinese delivery. #mcdonalds. #kraftmacaroni&cheese. #dominos. Microwave. High sodium. High Fructose Corn Syrup. Monosodium Glutimate. Intense flavors. Addictive flavors.

Browsing the internet, searching for a date. Swiping through thousands of profiles. The deep human need for connection. “Love to travel”. “Looking for a partner in crime”. “Enjoys witty banter”. Attempting to send thoughtful messages that will stand out. Being ignored. Rejected. Every once in a while a rare response. Variable rewards. You’ll never win if you don’t play the game. True love is just a swipe away. Dopamine. Slot machines. Addiction.


Friend; noun; a person whom one knows and with whom one has a bond of mutual affection. We “friend” each other. We “follow” each other. Do people have friendships anymore? What does it mean to be a friend when you know everyone through a screen?  What does it mean to be a human being?  I think back to my friends from college. I think I was always a little bit sad underneath it all. But friends are a good medicine.


We had fun back in college. This was before our jobs and our lives dragged us to all different corners of the country. Nowadays we talk about the #nfl or #GoT through group texts. Sometimes we wish each other happy birthday. Sometimes we forget.


Breaking news. Check your smart phone. Turn on your television. President Trump did this. President Trump did that. Terrorist attack. Hurricane. Polar Ice Caps melting. Destruction. Human beings are terrible to each other. Stay informed. Stay alert. More information makes better citizens. Information equals wisdom. Binge. Check #bbc, #cnn, #msnbc. Get updates and notifications. Twitter and social media keep us informed. Smart phones are smart.


Drugs and porn make me feel better. weed. A little coke. A little molly. None of it really make me happy, but they at least make me not sad for a while. A quick bump to take the pain away.
Everyone is an addict. Addiction is good for the economy. Some addictions are respectable. Some not so much. work, shopping, smart phones, #facebook, television, fossil fuels, #marvel super-hero movies, #mcdonalds, #instagram, pornography, video games, #dominos, coffee, alcohol, #snapchat, cocaine, #oxycontin, heroin. The economy is doing well.


We are all very happy.  It’s the best of times.  It’s the worst of times.


I talked to my sister a few weeks ago, she lives in Colorado. She used to live in Arizona, and before that North Carolina. I miss my sister. Like most young people she goes wherever she or her boyfriend can find work. She told me about her job, about how all her co-workers seem so fake. No one really seems to care about what they’re doing. It’s more important to make it seem like you care than it is to actually care.


The other day I saw a picture she posted with her co-workers – “So happy to work with these great people and this awesome company #workfriends”.


Our economy is great. Even though it rips apart the connections that we need for our emotional health, it always comes up with new products and services and gadgets for us to substitute for those connections and soothe our loneliness. One day we will all be staring at screens all the time and we’ll never have to interact with humans in the real world ever again. Life will be good.


Some people find meaning in their work. They work long hours. They go out drinking with co-workers. They work in advertising or tech or finance. They are helping our economy grow. Growing the economy is important. We may live on a finite planet, but we’re committed to an economy that can grow forever.


An economy is not the only type of organic system that can commit to a cycle of endless growth. Sometimes it happens with cells in the human body for instance. This is called cancer.


I sit at my desk pretending to work hard. Wondering what the other cubicle bees are doing with their time as they pretend to be working hard. Sometimes I do spreadsheets that people tell me are useful. #microsoft excel. #salesforce. Being able to measure and quantify all aspects of life is a valuable skill.


Once in a while I’ll grab lunch at the bodega or at #mcdonalds and I’ll notice how the employees there work so much harder than I do. Most of them are bi-lingual. They probably work harder in an hour than I do in a day.


I sit at a desk in front of a computer, so my job is really important.


There is nothing more shameful in life than being poor.


Smart phone. Smart TV. Smart car. Smart house. Smart city. We are smart.


When I get out of work I walk to the subway with all the other worker bees leaving their jobs. The sidewalks are buzzing with people heading this way and that. It’s important to walk fast to wherever it is you’re going. It’s important to go where you’re going and for everyone else to go where they’re going. Thinking about where you’re going is time wasted when you could be getting to where you’re going. Be careful if you smile at other people, they may see it as a threat.


At rush hour there is always a man on the corner near the subway with a sign that says “Jesus Loves You.” His eyes are powerful. He isn’t in a rush to get anywhere.


I love to learn. I love to read. I mostly hated school. Some of the most intelligent, interesting, and creative people I knew were dropouts.


School was useful for teaching us that life is about measurement and performance and specialization and commodification. Your peers are your competition. Things like empathy and imagination and cooperation are hard to measure. They’re non-linear. School doesn’t like them.


Prison population is something we can measure. There are 2.3 million Americans in Prison. There are more black men in prison today than there were enslaved at the time the Civil War began. America is the home of the Free and the Brave.


There was a pretty young woman at the register at the bookstore. She told me that she was a huge fan of the short stories I was getting. Said she loved the way the author plays with language and meaning. She reached to give me a bag for the book and I told her I didn’t really need one. She apologized and smiled and said that she must have asked me about a bag already. I told her that she hadn’t. She blushed. I asked her her name. I asked her for her number.


Later I sent her a message. Maybe I could take her out for a drink sometime, Smiley face emoji…I never got a reply.


Social media. Social. Media. We are social. We connect with our screens. Social media connects us to what is important. Likes, upvotes, retweets, friend requests, updates, notifications. That friendly buzzzzzz from your smart phone. It feels good to be social. Dopamine. Remember – Your brand matters. Everyone is watching.


Technology makes the world better. Technology solves problems, especially problems created by other technology. If new technologies create problems, the solution is to develop newer technologies to solve those problems. Technology and progress are the same thing. Technology helps the economy grow. When technology makes human beings obsolete, that is progress.


We relate to our machines better than we relate to each other.  #google knows the real me.  #instagram knows the real me.


One in sixty-eight children in America is diagnosed with autism. Autism is characterized by impaired social interaction, impaired verbal and non-verbal communication, and restricted and repetitive behavior.


I feel like my job isn’t actually about doing anything. Success is really about making it look like what you do is important. Lying to yourself to tell yourself that what you do is important.


Teamwork and cooperation are actively discouraged at work. No one knows what anyone else does, but supposedly what everyone does is important. Stare into your computer screen. Do we live in a world where success is about manipulating our fellow human beings? #winning


One day after work I saw an old woman on the subway with a young girl sleeping at her side. The woman was sewing a scarf. Sometimes people are good to each other. Sometimes the small things in life can be incredibly beautiful. Once in a while happiness will come when I’m not searching for it.


I wish I had a girlfriend. I wish I had someone I could talk to without feeling like I’m lying to myself. 


People around me are growing up. Getting married. Having kids. Settling into life. My conscience is at war with my culture.


One day I took a train out of the city. I took some molly. I was hoping to escape the traps of language. I needed nature. I needed art. I was looking for something that wasn’t for sale.


Our culture destroys community. #alienation is in our dictionary, next to #truth. Nobody knows anybody, nobody knows themselves. We project onto anyone who reflects the pain and fear hidden within ourselves – those who are suffering the most – the poor, the homeless, the drug addicts, the immigrants, the crazy, the uneducated. Anyone with a political ideology different from our own. Organic human interaction doesn’t exist, all that matters is your ability to sell and your ability to consume. Smile for #instagram, smile for #facebook. Image is everything. 


Human beings are commodities. Numbers to be counted.  We stare into screens, selling ourselves to each other. We desperately hang on for a sense of meaning and purpose to a culture which is destroying the ecosystems that we depend on for life. A culture which transforms our deep emotional need for meaning and connection into a deep emotional need for products.


In 2017 there were 72,000 deaths in America from heroin and prescription opioids. These drugs are pain killers. Pain. Killers. What pain are we trying to kill?


Some of the best people I know are chronic drug users, some of them functional, some of them not so much. What does it mean to be a human being?


Once I got so lonely that I was no longer myself. I was the hive. The people moving to and fro, the traffic, the ambulances, the delivery boys on their bicycles, the junkies, the couples hand in hand on the sidewalks, the children and dogs playing in the park, the street festivals, the subway cars rumbling through their tunnels. It was all me.


The sounds of the city are music. Everything is frequency. A constant buzzing.


We cannot acknowledge our pain and fear in our screen environment, we can only smile and sell ourselves. Our pain is filtered into tribalism. In a world that is more connected than ever, we hold tighter and tighter to old markers of identity.  Tribalism and hatred and racism and misogyny haven’t disappeared in our interconnected global village, they’ve morphed and increased in scale. Morality and empathy function differently in this environment. There is only Us and the Other. The safe space and the enemy.  War gives us meaning.  If there is no enemy, one will have to be invented.

I miss my sister. I miss my whole family. Including my extended family that I don’t really know. Sometimes I think that humans aren’t really supposed to behave like bees in a hive and that we are actually designed to live close to our families and our friends and work close to where we live. Maybe work and life and culture and happiness aren’t supposed to be separate things. “Commute” is a silly word. There’s a hope somewhere deep down that we actually need each other… that people are worth it.


As a #straight #cisgender #whitemale, I sometimes feel that I’m not allowed to be upset about the world we live in, I’m not allowed to be hurt by it. I need to #checkmyprivilege. Maybe I just need more drugs.


It’s important for us to be living in a state of constant consumption. After all, what are we if we’re not consumers? What does it mean to be a human being?


Sex sells. Sex is a good product. Orgasms can be counted. How many people have you fucked? I don’t know how to have a genuinely vulnerable emotional connection with another human being. What happens after the orgasm? Connecting with someone who you hope to have an intimate and beautiful relationship with is about selling yourself. Always remember: You Are A PRODUCT.


Make sure you have a great profile pic. Remember, self-expression is about crafting an image that other people will like. These are your #friends. This is advertising, people don’t want to know the real you. Make sure you look sexy at all times. Ugliness doesn’t sell. Swipe your way to happiness. Hearts. Likes. Thumbs Up. Everyone’s there. An entire city. The entire world. A busy hive.


Drugs are Good drugs when society says they’re Good drugs. Good drugs are legal, Bad drugs are illegal.


Good people Hate president Trump. It’s important to have socially acceptable outlets for channeling negative emotions when living in an oppressive culture. Ridiculing and making fun of Trump and his supporters is something we can all do together and share in the fun.


Is it possible that Trump supporters might be human beings too? Is it possible that hatred is just fear and pain turned outward?
How’s your social media presence? What does it mean to have “presence”? Where am I when I have #presence? Presence; noun; the state or fact of being present; current existence or occurrence.


Science and technology allow us to track and influence the behavior of massive numbers of human beings. The patterns of the hive. How does the swarm function?


Humans can be tracked by their clicks, by the amount of time their eyes interact with their screens. Our consumption habits and behavior can then be predicted and influenced using algorithms. The more data there is the more accurate the predictions. Feedback loops from past behavior can be used to influence future behavior. What we consume tells us who we are and who we will be. #hashtag it. Humans are just numbers after all. Numbers that can be measured, counted, commodified.


Tech and big data are amazing. It’s really great the way the tech industry helps our economy. Why judge people by the content of their character when there are statistics and algorithms? More products to help the economy grow. What does it mean to be a human being?


After the Civil War, the former slaves were free to make their way in this home of the Free and the Brave. During the reconstruction period in the South, it was common for freed slaves to be thrown in jail for no other reason than the fact that they didn’t have work. Once there, they were forced into chain gangs to build railroads and other infrastructure projects. Many died due to terrible conditions and over-work. Railroads were important because they brought industry and technology and economic growth. Economic progress makes the world better.


Every once in a while I reconnect to the world outside of my screens. I get the rare chance to talk with friends or co-workers and I have the impression that they are genuinely interested in having a positive impact in the world and in their community. Why do I feel so alienated at work, and in life? Why are we so disconnected in a world of constant connection? It has something to do with the system, the wider culture. Culture is powerful.


Worker bees working, the rhythms of the hive.


A beautiful fall day in Central Park. An oasis amidst the concrete. The wind blows through the trees, leaves shimmering in the sun. Fractals. The individual elements reflect structural patterns of the whole.


A beehive is an amazing thing. We can’t understand the hive by looking at the behavior of an individual bee, yet the combined behavior of the bees create a new phenomenon that is more than the sum of its parts – the hive. Swarming is like a cultural phenomenon of the hive. It is a pattern of the hive reflected in the bees.


The heroin addict reflects our culture of addiction. The cancer patient reflects our pathological attachment to endless growth. The autistic child reflects a society in which we have lost the ability to empathize, lost the ability to feel and understand one another. A black man murdered in the street reflects a culture in which human life is just a number. Humans are products. A salesman for president is a reflection of us. It shows us who we are.


The Art of the Deal. President. Salesman. Don’t forget that you’re for sale. Everyone’s watching.


The personalities that thrive in the modern world are those that embody the traits of psychopathy. Rapid turnover in interpersonal relationships. Lack of any real need for a sense of community or place. Focus on the superficial and image-based forms of communication as opposed to depth and nuance. Lack of empathy. Commoditized, fragmented, specialized and depersonalized interactions with others and with the planet. We are all engulfed in this culture. There aren’t any good guys or bad guys. Causality is non-linear. We’re all guilty. We are a society in which the ability to consume is our highest virtue and being poor is a moral failure. Poor people hate themselves and each other for being poor and worship rich people for being rich. Rich people hate themselves just as much as poor people, if not more so. Can you ever consume enough to create an identity? What does it mean to be a human being? Technology, screens and financial capital. Fossil fuels. Endless War. Drone Strikes. 150 to 200 of the species that make up the biosphere of planet earth go extinct every single day. 2,220,300 people incarcerated in the United States of America. Home of the Free and the Brave.


I don’t have a single person that I feel I can talk to about things that matter to me. I don’t have a single relationship where I feel I can be comfortable being myself, where I feel understood. Attempts that I make to connect are met with rejection. I fail over and over and over again. The relationships I do have are superficial. Why am I so broken? Sometimes I think that I might have something positive to offer.


Does the bee comprehend the nature of the hive? There are 7.442 billion human beings on planet earth. The individual human brain does not work with those kinds of numbers. We can’t relate to 7,442,000,000. 7,442,000,000 are not faces that we know. 7,442,000,000 is not connected to place. The way we make sense of 7,442,000,000… is as a number - a product - a resource. #humanresources. A resource to be exploited and used for all that it’s worth and then discarded along with the rest of the natural world. Success in our culture, in the industrial juggernaut that we call our economy, comes from the ability to manipulate the largest number of human beings, from figuring out and implementing the most efficient ways of turning human beings and the planet into a #commodity.

I interpreted less likely to believe the news as ""entrench in preconceived positions"".
Most people you talk to will say they pay attention to the 'news'. It's just that due to the capitalist effect on ratings, most everyone is with their own version of news that they consume. Hashtags are a terrible way to consume current events. If someone could make that into a hashtag, thanks. I don't Twit~

> However, readers who identified themselves as “extremely liberal” did not perceive social media news content about gender and racial issues as partisan, regardless of hashtag presence.

Well, I don't know if I'd say I'm extremely liberal.  But when I read the title the first thing I thought was that it was fundamentally offensive to victims, largely women, to take the position that their victimhood is inherently political.

Personally I think authoritarian right wing billionaires and greedy 'left wing' billionaires are making people less likely to believe the news

When I see the pound ME too hashtag , I assume it's a disgruntled ex trying to start a witch hunt

It seems oftentimes as of late that the varying and often incompatible strategies of communication that different groups and individuals are receptive to are as great a problem as the content of communication itself. I care deeply about progressive values and want there to be greater knowledge of studies like this to _improve_ general advocacy to broader audiences. I wish the headline featured some of the hashtags contained in paragraph #3, for balance, in order to improve its receptivity among liberal readers.

The data science behind this work is really well done and it worth the read. below are the concluding remarks of the authors. 

**Patterns and Conclusions** 

The aim of this piece of data analysis and visualisation is to glean a few of the tactics of the Internet Research Agency with regard to interference in foreign affairs and elections, using Twitter as a platform. With the English-language dataset, we have focused on the United States presidential election, with the occasional note concerning the United Kingdom. As stated earlier, for the Russian-language dataset, our focus has been on form, format, and distribution, rather than content. We conclude: 

* The Internet Research Agency prefers to use trending hashtags like #ifgooglewasagirl, and #myamazonwishlist to get in on conversations. This allows both bot- and manually-operated accounts to gain followers from a broad spectrum of Twitter users. 
* The Internet Research Agency tested spam bots (the green ‘exercise’ and US-topic accounts), spreading high volumes of URLs in 2015. They subsequently abandoned this strategy within four months when these accounts failed to gain more than 700 followers (the number is arbitrary; the volume is key). 
* The year a Twitter account was created played a significant role in the bot type created: 
   * 2013 (purple) bots were in on potentially polarising conversations in the centre of the network, and were the key US election tweeters in the network 
   * 2014 (blue) bots were used to retweet trending hashtags - Except for a small number of accounts, 2015 (green) bots never tweeted for more than two months. Although they all posted large volumes of content, they never gained sufficient popularity or influence, which perhaps explains why they were never used again 
   * There were few 2016 (navy blue) bots, but one continued tweeting long past the first anniversary of Trump’s election, despite not gaining great popularity (> 5,000 followers)
   * 2017 (orange) bots were only used in August 2017 and posted hashtags but did not try to engage with other Twitter users through mentions
* The centre of both English-language networks resembles a magnet with two opposing forces
   * This means that the Internet Research Agency bots in each section were retweeting different accounts, and using different hashtags
   * One side appears to be weighted toward the US election, while the another is more related to #BlackLivesMatter tweets
   * It would appear that all Internet Research Agency accounts (released by Twitter) were disposable, and would not be reused if they were unsuccessful accounts
   * 2014 (blue) bots appear to be more automated than 2013 (purple) bots (it is possible the 2013 bots have more advanced algorithms for targeting specific content—this bears further research, should the data be made available)
   * The blue trending topic net was non-polarizing, and simply retweeted trending hashtags (this is automatable), and only deployed towards the centre of the network at pivotal times—early 2015 (the time of creation), and the end of 2016 (the US election)
   * The purple centre cluster was polarized by the directions of the bursts, and the accounts seldom interact with one other until the approach of the US election (November 2016)
* There were distinct locations within the visualisations for certain types of tweets, as those accounts tended to form ‘communities’ around their tweeting habits (or algorithms)
* In both the Russian-language mention and hashtag networks, accounts with more than 1,000 followers tended to target the same users and hashtags
* Usage of different groups of hashtags changed over time, as did targeted users over time
* Russian-language tweeting tapered off immediately at the start of 2016
* The most tweeted moment in the entire Russian-language dataset was the day after Flight MH17 was shot down over Ukraine (July 2014)
* The highly organized Russian-language subset:
   * There is an interesting community of bots tweeting at a group of accounts from September 2014 – October 2015.","I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

There are people who murder who don’t get that. To say that this guy doesn’t deserve to earn money is also a bit absurd? Like, what, is he supposed to be homeless for the rest of his life? Work at an “unglamorous” job? Don’t get me wrong. Rapists suck ass.

On November 25, As I Lay Dying is scheduled to play at House of Blues Boston. The lead singer of this band attempted to hire a hitman to murder his estranged wife. There is no ambiguity about this. He is guilty. Unfortunately, because he is a rich cisgender white Christian man, he was allowed to leave jail days after this attempted murder because he could afford $2,000,000 for bail. Can you imagine the terror that his victim felt knowing he was walking free as he awaited trial? I can. When he was convicted, this man only served two years in prison. There are poor people and queer people and black people serving longer terms for selling marijuana. It’s not House of Blues’ business to fix the criminal justice system, but it is their business to operate ethically and support the concerns of music fans and musical artists.

In 2017, the immensely popular pop-punk band Brand New put out a new record and sold out every show on their tour. In the middle of that tour, a young woman made a Facebook post alleging that the lead singer had seduced her and regularly exchanged illicit images and text messages with her when she was 15 years old. The singer’s response to this was to issue a blanket apology to anyone he had harmed with his sexual addiction, and to announce that his band would no longer tour out of respect for anyone he had harmed. The general reaction of the fanbase was that this apology and action wasn’t nearly enough, and that the singer should have had more accountability and seen more consequences. That’s the level of accountability expected by the majority of music fans in 2019.

The singer of As I Lay Dying, who I refuse to name because he does not deserve to be recognized as a public figure, has had no accountability for his actions. Two years in prison is the blink of an eye compared to the lifetime of trauma he has caused his victim and her children. The only reason this tour isn’t a public relations nightmare is because he’s not famous enough to be on anyone’s radar. Giving this man a platform to acquire wealth and social capital is a slap in the face to every victim who has ever become invisible in their abuser’s shadow. It’s an affront to the #metoo movement, to #blacklivesmatter, to feminism, equality, and social justice. Shining a spotlight on this band just because they can sell tickets is a political statement so tone deaf that it’s not far off from hosting a KKK rally because “Hey, those guys run up an impressive bar tab.”

**What you can do if this upsets you:**

\-Call the Live Nation customer service at 1 (800) 653-8000 and tell them you’re not comfortable with As I Lay Dying playing in Boston.

\-Call House of Blues Manger Allison Finney at 1 (617) 960-8338 and tell her you’re not comfortable with As I Lay Dying playing at a venue that you love.

Either way, BE CIVIL AND RESPECTFUL. The people answering your calls are just employees. They very well may be just as outraged as you are. Don’t get angry, just make sure your voice is heard!

**What you can do if you’re really upset:**

\-Meet us in front of Game On! at 82 Lansdowne St in Boston, right by Fenway Park, at 10:30am tomorrow, November 25th. Bring your #metoo signs, wear your pride colors, and be angry – but be civil. It is important to show the workers who have chosen to tour with this band that while they are just desperate for a paycheck, aiding this man’s success is unacceptable. Compose yourselves; the intention is to draw attention and awareness, and not to be confrontational.","Looked into this. Hired a undercover police officer/Hitman on 2013, Pleaded guilty in 2014, sentenced to six years of prison, released on parole in 2016.

Where were u when Chris Brown was here in September?

It’s a good thing he is a white Christian, no musicians of color have ever gotten away with a criminal record or a history of abuse

I hear this vague word ""accountability"" thrown around a lot. What does that look like to you?

or you could show your displeasure by just not buying tickets and allowing other people to make their own decisions

I'd love for you to do your protest outside the HOB before the show starts...really getem good

>On May 7, 2013, Lambesis was arrested in Oceanside, California, US after hiring an undercover detective to kill his estranged wife. The report was made by the San Diego County Sheriff's Department, leaving the future of the band uncertain.[46] On the following day, the band released a statement in which they said: ""The legal process is taking its course and we have no more information than you do. There are many unanswered questions, and the situation will become clearer in the coming days and weeks. We'll keep you informed as best we can."" They also stated that their thoughts were ""with Tim, his family, and with everyone else affected by this terrible situation.""[47] Eight days later, the band cancelled their mid-2013 tour with Killswitch Engage, stating that ""we feel that it is best for the band to be off the road while the current situation gets sorted"".[48] During the month of his initial arrest, Lambesis pleaded ""not guilty"" and his lawyer stated: ""His thought processes were devastatingly affected by his steroid use.""[49] On February 25, 2014 Lambesis changed his plea from ""not guilty"" to ""guilty"" and consequently faced a potential sentence of nine years in prison.[50][51]

He also sued the CA prisons saying he grew breasts because they denied him steroid-withdrawal medication.

BUT THERES PEOPLE IN JAIL FOR MARJUANA!!

Having the self awareness to understand that people who have egregiously misused their positions of power to relinquish the luxury of having that power.

You mean by letting them know the lead singer is a fucking terrible person and offering an opportunity to protest the band?

Why do you feel the need to defend a guy who tried to murder his wife? What's in it for you?

Again, that's pretty vague. Using the example of Brand New, what would you have that singer do? What consequences should he face? Who should impose them?

If you're a fan of this irrelevant band I'm sure you know the story already

I would have him relinquish his position of having a cultural voice.

How is that done in practice? Isn't stopping touring a pretty good way to do that?

Yes! I was using Brand New as an example of someone who did things appropriately.

Oh shoot, my bad! I totally misread your op. Thanks for your patience in answering my questions, though! I better understand what you were saying and wish you luck with your action.

37,ThatDeviantOne,"Why are so many ""activists"" absolutely shit at their causes?",24,dyqpmz,https://www.reddit.com/r/kotakuinaction2/comments/dyqpmz/why_are_so_many_activists_absolutely_shit_at/,19,2019-11-20 13:01:04,"I swear when it comes to activism in first world countries, at least America, many of them are over things that have already been done like equal pay for women or causing way more harm than good. Now, I’m not saying there isn’t legit causes to fight for, like the people directly in Hong Kong fighting for their human rights. What really pisses me off is when people act like certain “activists” are “stunning and brave” for speaking out against certain things. So you spoke out against Trump? How is that brave? The secret police isn’t going to get you if you bad mouth the president. There isn’t a hidden cult of alt right Trump supporters who will hunt you down if you speak ill of Trump. Unless you’re in some far right job, you’re probably not going to get fired if you don’t support Trump when you’re not at work. Like 90% of Trump coverage by the media is negative. If anything, it’s way more risky to actively show support for Trump. I don’t know the exact dangers, but I think the Hong Kong protesters are in far more real danger compared to people safely behind a computer screen. I’m not calling myself brave for speaking out against Blizzard because I know I’m in no real danger of anything bad happening to me for doing so. I’m not making this to defend or support Trump, but rather using him as an example of how I feel a lot of “activism” is dumb.

For example, there’s a YouTube channel called Equality Can’t Wait. As of this writing, they have less than a thousand subs. They claim it’ll take 208 years for women’s equality in America. There’s been several videos debunking them. Here’s their most viewed video with 1.3 million views…

https://youtu.be/SpiMb8VOUpU

While also having about 1% likes to dislikes and comments disabled. Oh sure, talk a big game about talking, than get cold feet when people call you out. What really pisses me off is how can these people be so stupid?! They must spend a lot of money on these videos, yet they couldn’t get *one* person that was like “wait, stop. These messages are flawed and will undermine our talking points”. This channel is just one example of many others like it. Does it seriously not even cross their mind at all of how other attempts like this failed in the pass and hence? I guess they think they didn’t double down hard enough.

Shitty activism is why I hate #BlackLivesMatter and don’t stand by most trans activists. BLM tend to be quite racist and can’t even give a good answer to “why not #AllLivesMatters”. Then they are very anti-police, acting like all police officers, regardless of race, are racist. Like what is their alternate, mob “justice”? I absolute hate when they riot, because what good does damaging where you live do? It makes them look like a bunch of violent wild animals, not people willing to have a reasonable discussion. I do agree there are black specific problems like how many black children not growing up with a father and gang violence, but BLM isn’t a good solution.

I hate trans “activists” because they say things like how misgendering is violence. They argue you don’t need gender dysphoria to be transgender. Hence, we get transtrenders who will do things like make no effort to modify their appearance and insist on being called what they clearly don’t look like. They won’t call out how transwomen in sports absolutely destroy their foes, which is unfair to all the women involved. They call people bigoted for not wanting to date transpeople. Well, excuse people for having preferences. Maybe they want someone who can give birth. Perhaps they want a woman with a vagina, not a “feminine” penis. They try to shame and guilt trap people into dating transgender people. Umm… excuse me? No one is owed romance or sex. Don’t tell me I don’t understand because I am in this position. Riley Dennis is a shining example of how *not* to “help”.

Well, that turned out to be a much longer rant than intended when I meant to just have the first two paragraphs.",">So you spoke out against Trump? How is that brave?

I've gotten downvoted more than once in the default subreddits for telling people ""You think that making fun of Trump makes you edgy and rebellious?  It's literally what Jimmy Kimmel does every single night.  Being anti-Trump is one of the most safe and politically correct stances you can take.""

You seem to be very, very new here.

What you're looking at is not pragmatic activism with a set end goal, but a decentralized ideological movement that will adopt any cause so long as it gives them more power. Its cohesion depends heavily on praising the ""few"" good people who choose to become part of the anointed, and on denigrating, attacking, and eventually exterminating those who do not.
>**The revolutionary knows that in the very depths of his being, not only in words but also in deeds, he has broken all the bonds which tie him to the social order and the civilized world with all its laws, moralities, and customs, and with all its generally accepted conventions.** He is their implacable enemy, and if he continues to live with them it is only in order to destroy them more speedily.

>The revolutionary despises all doctrines and refuses to accept the mundane sciences, leaving them for future generations. He knows only one science: the science of destruction. For this reason, but only for this reason, he will study mechanics, physics, chemistry, and perhaps medicine. But all day and all night he studies the vital science of human beings, their characteristics and circumstances, and all the phenomena of the present social order. The object is perpetually the same: the surest and quickest way of destroying the whole filthy order.

>The revolutionary despises public opinion. He despises and hates the existing social morality in all its manifestations. **For him, morality is everything which contributes to the triumph of the revolution. Immoral and criminal is everything that stands in its way.**

>The revolutionary is a dedicated man, merciless toward the State and toward the educated classes; and he can expect no mercy from them. Between him and them there exists, declared or concealed, a relentless and irreconcilable war to the death. **He must accustom himself to torture.**

>**Tyrannical toward himself, he must be tyrannical toward others. All the gentle and enervating sentiments of kinship, love, friendship, gratitude, and even honor, must be suppressed in him and give place to the cold and single-minded passion for revolution. For him, there exists only one pleasure, one consolation, one reward, one satisfaction – the success of the revolution.** Night and day he must have but one thought, one aim – merciless destruction. Striving cold-bloodedly and indefatigably toward this end, he must be prepared to destroy himself and to destroy with his own hands everything that stands in the path of the revolution.

>**The revolutionary can have no friendship or attachment, except for those who have proved by their actions that they, like him, are dedicated to revolution.** The degree of friendship, devotion and obligation toward such a comrade is determined solely by the degree of his usefulness to the cause of total revolutionary destruction. 

>**All revolutionaries should have under them second- or third-degree revolutionaries – i.e., comrades who are not completely initiated.** These should be regarded as part of the common revolutionary capital placed at his disposal. This capital should, of course, be spent as economically as possible in order to derive from it the greatest possible profit. The real revolutionary should regard himself as capital consecrated to the triumph of the revolution; however, he may not personally and alone dispose of that capital without the unanimous consent of the fully initiated comrades. 

>The revolutionary enters the world of the State, of the privileged classes, of the so-called civilization, and he lives in this world only for the purpose of bringing about its speedy and total destruction. He is not a revolutionary if he has any sympathy for this world. **He should not hesitate to destroy any position, any place, or any man in this world. He must hate everyone and everything in it with an equal hatred.** All the worse for him if he has any relations with parents, friends, or lovers; he is no longer a revolutionary if he is swayed by these relationships.

>This filthy social order can be split up into several categories. The first category comprises those who must be condemned to death without delay. Comrades should compile a list of those to be condemned according to the relative gravity of their crimes; and the executions should be carried out according to the prepared order.

>When a list of those who are condemned is made, and the order of execution is prepared, no private sense of outrage should be considered, nor is it necessary to pay attention to the hatred provoked by these people among the comrades or the people. **Hatred and the sense of outrage may even be useful insofar as they incite the masses to revolt.** It is necessary to be guided only by the relative usefulness of these executions for the sake of revolution. **Above all, those who are especially inimical to the revolutionary organization must be destroyed; their violent and sudden deaths will produce the utmost panic in the government, depriving it of its will to action by removing the cleverest and most energetic supporters.**

>**The third category consists of a great many brutes in high positions, distinguished neither by their cleverness nor their energy, while enjoying riches, influence, power, and high positions by virtue of their rank. These must be exploited in every possible way; they must be implicated and embroiled in our affairs, their dirty secrets must be ferreted out, and they must be transformed into slaves. Their power, influence, and connections, their wealth and their energy, will form an inexhaustible treasure and a precious help in all our undertakings.**

>**The fourth category comprises ambitious office-holders and liberals of various shades of opinion. The revolutionary must pretend to collaborate with them, blindly following them, while at the same time, prying out their secrets until they are completely in his power. They must be so compromised that there is no way out for them, and then they can be used to create disorder in the State.**

>The sixth category is especially important: women. They can be divided into three main groups. First, those frivolous, thoughtless, and vapid women, whom we shall use as we use the third and fourth category of men. Second, women who are ardent, capable, and devoted, but whom do not belong to us because they have not yet achieved a passionless and austere revolutionary understanding; these must be used like the men of the fifth category. Finally, **there are the women who are completely on our side – i.e., those who are wholly dedicated and who have accepted our program in its entirety. We should regard these women as the most valuable or our treasures; without their help, we would never succeed.**

>The Society has no aim other than the complete liberation and happiness of the masses – i.e., of the people who live by manual labor. Convinced that their emancipation and the achievement of this happiness can only come about as a result of an all-destroying popular revolt, **the Society will use all its resources and energy toward increasing and intensifying the evils and miseries of the people until at last their patience is exhausted and they are driven to a general uprising**.

*The Revolutionary Catechism*, 1869 (excerpts; emphasis mine)

I would also think that real activism would be about winning over hearts and minds to your cause

Attacking, smearing and shaming people who disagree with you in the slightest does not win hearts and minds, it makes people despise you.

I think the main issue is many of these bad activists suffer from narcissism or some other disorder, and their activisism is more about putting on a show than to accomplish anything real

My guess is that a lot of them make a paycheck from being ""activists"" so they don't really care if they help or not as long as they are being paid, and even if they don't some of them have a desire to feel like they're doing something, even if they're not helping, so for them it's not about fighting transphobia or racism but about looking good.

>No one is owed romance or sex. 

I would still like some though

They don't give a damn about social change and just want attention. 

Gen X/Millennial kids grew up with dire warnings about watching too much TV in our childhood.  We *never* could have foreseen social media.

""The issue is never the issue. The issue is always the revolution.""

They're ""professional"" Karens.

Sometimes I think that they are what the conspiracy heads call a limited hangout. Someone who's job is to discredit the cause they are 'fighting' for.  
  
But then I remember that there are a lot of idiots in the world.

Orange man... good?

Whoa, that makes a ton of sense. So basically, they just use anyone who agrees with them as a means of controlling society even more? I know way back in August 2014 I felt betrayed after realizing I was just a pawn toward a terrible goal.

""The issue is not the issue.  The issue is the revolution.""

Narcissism is probably the biggest issue we've been dealing with for years against these people. They clearly don't care who they step over, even the very people they claim to support, if it means they can brag about how ""morally righteous"" they are. Sadly, I think this is largely a by product of the Internet, where anyone can get on and post what they want.

The Civil Rights Movement was way more real activism with actually attempting to bring about positive social changes. Not this modern ""activism"" that's way more about tearing down people than actually helping anyone but the ""activist"".

You think correctly.

They're pretty great, just wish the cost wasn't so high.

I mean, it's a manual, of course it is.

Hardly surprising. Lenin leaned heavily on Nechayev's work, as does every Communist that wishes to succeed.

Which, given how Marx denounced Nechayev's authoritarian anarchism, means that every modern-day Communist is not a true Communist.

&#x200B;

Recently during a student hackathon, I built a website called [www.MemesCureDepression.com](https://www.MemesCureDepression.com) it's not really a business or even charity (I'm trying to raise money for ANY charity of your choice). I am just trying to kickstart the next ""#MeToo"" or ""#BlackLivesMatter"", nothing more. TBH, I want this as a side-project for my CS resume

&#x200B;

I just find it ridiculous that people are doing #TidePodChallenge or #KikiChallenge (where you step-out to dance out of a moving car).

So far I have done the following:

1. Create an MVP website in [Wix.com](https://Wix.com) (3ish hours and I can re-build without the goofy-ness if it goes viral)
2. Create a poster for a college competition (also 3 hours)

&#x200B;

[3rd iteration. Should I remove my face? lol 😂 ](https://preview.redd.it/9pjprq06wiy31.png?width=608&format=png&auto=webp&s=52ec444b190dd635f83d49a2f9c0364fd617b65a)

&#x200B;

1. Actually build the biggest wall of memes in my state where my friends helped me. (the school tore it down because I didn't ask for permission; expected)
2. Going to our school's biggest rival and coordinating with their State Press to release an article about building a bigger wall to beat us in our own challenge. Hopefully, the rivalry/controversy will create better traction

My current move is sending random email challenging other nearby schools (Student Organizations like Change-Makers, or Mental Health Clubs). I'll be honest it's been reeeeally hard even when asking friends from old community College. I'm a senior in college and work part-time so I can't put a lot of time into side-project. 

&#x200B;

**What should my next step be?** Asking for donations puts people off. I'm thinking of changing step #2 to ""Tell us what you do when you feel sad""","I studied this in grad school. Almost nothing goes viral on accident. ""Virality"", in most cases, is really the result of coordinated campaigns by super influencers. 

Or, like many of the viral memes from the last few years, it's 4chan playing a joke on the ""normies."" The nonsense makes it funny, so you feel more motivated to share it because making people laugh brings social approval.

Another factor is that many of the overnight successes we see propped up in the news are actually the result of years and years of work.

You've got a decent idea, but you can't expect your thing to go viral because that's not really real or predictable. Find another marketing strategy. :) Good luck!

I find this comment to be one of the most helpful ones. Thank you!

Thanks this is actually a very good idea. I’m done begging students because we’re all super busy (and poor lol). 

I’ll see if I can convince the hacker 4chan. Problem is. Everytime you summon them, you flip a coin. They could literally dox you and make your life hell or help you spread a stupid meme.

Neither the FBI or CDC consider made to penetrate as a form of rape. It's no wonder the statics show that an overwhelming majority of rapists are men.

That's actually a really good point and I hadn't noticed that hypocrisy, feminists are more than willing to dismiss statistics with crime in black communities but the moment it involves men being racists it's an instant switch around. Good catch on that one and it's fascinating I actually thought that discriminating against men was the one thing they were pretty consistent on but it looks like even that is interchangeable.

Especially since most people who bring up the crime report are simply debunking the ""widespread police racism"" lie, while feminists are attempting to argue that male survivors should be ignored.

Spork's post just makes feminists even more evil.

Feminists are entirely reliant on the ""us vs them"" mentality, women (victims) vs men (perpetrators). Male victims of rape must be silenced as these men cannot exist in the feminist narrative. If feminists accept men as victims, then the ""men are perpetrators"" strawman is undermined. 

In addition, maintaining the feminist dominance of DV and sexual violence victim services ensures continuing government and charitable funding of feminist enclaves ($100s millions nationally). These enclaves then continue to spread the feminist narrative citing feminist ideology backed by selective statistics.

That does make sense and of course they couldn't give a shit about straight white males which is why they can dismiss rape statistics and so on.

45,,"In the beginning of this year I was Anti-Bernie, now I'm one of his biggest supporters. Here's what happened:",216,dv6t8j,https://www.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/dv6t8j/in_the_beginning_of_this_year_i_was_antibernie/,52,2019-11-12 23:45:21,"I don't know where to put this but I wanted to rant about this. Here's a little bit of background on me. I supported Bernie in 2016. I was 16 years old. I was also an anti-SJW and anti-PC, and just generally an awful person. I was a ""Bernie Bro"" some people might fight against that characterization, but that stereotype definitely fit me even though I'm not white. The next year I went through something traumatic. And this experience changed my perception of life completely. I became and I still am full-on SJW, and I'm proud of that fact. 

That being the case everything since that event took place, my life has been a response to who I used to be. I started doing things the opposite. So when this election cycle first started up in January, I didn't support Bernie. And I was essentially anti-Bernie. I thought a lot of the criticism about Bernie was coming from a progressive place. And while some of that is true, no candidate is above criticism. However, most of the anti-Bernie people on twitter are criticizing him from a very conservative place. But they called themselves progressives, and that's what tricked me, that's how I fell for that.

I would then spend my time on a certain anti-Sanders subreddit. And I thought I had found people who were progressive that just didn't like some of the toxic supporters of Sanders (before I get slagged off for this, every candidate running has toxic supporters that harass people). And I do believe there were a lot of genuine progressives at first. But as time went on and I started to cool off, I noticed a lot more conservatives and conservative talking points. Stuff like ""looney left"" and ""fracking is actually good for the environment."" A lot of misunderstanding about basic civil rights, people were complaining about BlackLivesMatter, about Colin Kapernick, and people were complaining about the MeToo movement when Biden got hit. So the fake-progressive veil that I was looking at these guys through was being pulled back, and I was seeing the ugly conservative face that they really had.

So I stopped going on that subreddit. And for a while, I was kind of in the middle. I wasn't exactly supportive of Bernie, but I didn't hate him. I knew that if it came down to him and Biden I would vote for Bernie hands down. But my preference was Warren and my second place was Kamala. Well, what ended up happening is that I decided to read more liberal and progressive news sources. I was reading The American Prospect, The New Republic, The Nation, Current Affairs, and I was listening to The Majority Report with Sam Seder. And I was reading and listening to a lot of criticisms of Kamala, and I agreed with them. She was already really disappointing me with her walk backs on Medicare-For-All and other progressive policies. And the arguments from these progressive news sources were so good and I couldn't find anything wrong with them, or anything that I disagreed with, that I ended up dropping my support of her. I couldn't be a progressive and support her, I just couldn't.

And Bernie was already becoming more likable in my mind and I was firmly putting him in second place behind Warren. And then he had his heart attack, and I realized how important of a figure he was to progressives. It's really incredible how he was able to push the Democratic Party to the left, and how he was able to change the conversations we have about healthcare and education, in a huge way, with only one Presidential run. That's something that had never really been done before. I had also realized that I could support him, not in the sexist hateful way that I did before, but as someone with more empathy and compassion.

And as soon as he was back I was happy. I was genuinely happy to see him back in there fighting for us. And then I read a few more things. 

[This article from Politico highlighting Latino support for Bernie.](https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/30/latinos-bernie-sanders-2020-strategy-060645)

[And this article from The Nation about his immigration plan.](https://www.thenation.com/article/bernie-sanders-immigration-2020/)

As a Latino, and as a child of immigrants, this really struck a chord in my heart. How could I not support him if so many of my people are supporting him? How could I not support him if he's willing to stop the terror that ICE is inflicting on my people in a way that no other candidate is willing? 

I still love Warren. And I think we would be lucky to have her as the nominee. But my heart lies with Bernie, para mi familia.

Edit: I just want to point out that I’ve read the criticisms of Warren. I’ve seen everything. You don’t have to point it out. I still love her. We can cool it with that.

One thing to keep in mind is Bernie is creating a people powered movement. No one else is close to doing that.

Fantastic late night read.

Glad to have you. This movement is about fighting for everyone, glad that you realized that.

We're in this together.

Bienvenido hermano,  it is so good to hear that you've grown as a person but I am sorry that you had to go through something awful. Hope you are doing better and thank you for opening your heart to more female friendly thoughts. Somos familia,  we all need to realise that and fight for each other. Warren didn't support the people at Standing Rock,  even after claiming to be their family,  I do not trust her.  Talk is cheap, actions are where you see a person's true character and loyalties.

at Standing Rock,  against the Muslim ban, at civil rights protests.... Every. Bloody. Time. For 40 years! I definitely want ICE abolished,  did you see the emails our campaign sent out to warn people of ICE raids in certain cities?  There is also a profoundly moving video of Bernie fighting for these Latino immigrants that were being paid less than starvation wages in a desperately poor town.  He's been giving it his all,  now it's our turn.  Are you registered Dem to make sure Bernie is the nominee?

That's beautiful thanks for sharing.

Not trying to start a fight, but how is it you weren't aware of Bernie's policies from 2016? At what point did you actually start researching what Bernie actually stood for (rather than listen to what sheep in wolves clothing had to say)?

Warren has said she will NOT abolish ICE, just saying!

Bienvenido al club! ;)

What was that event that turned you into a SJW?

Thanks for sharing! Own your path!

Really good read and glad to see you do your research and come to your own conclusion. Honestly following Bernie and watching his videos, it really gives a unique feeling compared to other candidates. 

It’s inspirational and you really do feel like there’s a movement happening. Not just in this country but countries around the world people are being more and more fed up with the way things are with the rich and status quo. Bernie is the tip of the spear and the voice of that movement. 

It’s like he’s been fighting the fight mostly alone and only now are people catching up to him and thinking that things can change. That’s why I support him because I can trust him to fight for people because he has done it his entire life. It truly feels like the fight of our lifetime and he’s a once in a lifetime candidate. Solidarity always.

Welcome back, friend! Lets fight together ❤️

These stories scare me and make me doubt the power of the people. This kid could watch an alt-right documentary about Hitler being the second coming of Christ, and he'd believe it. Some people are just so gullible and malleable that they might as well not believe anything. We've got to start teaching logic in elementary school.

No lo quiero insultar, pero, fuck, man, cómo es posible apoyar a Bernie en el 2016 y luego pasarse a ser anti-Bernie cuando todos los problemas de que él hablaba han empeorado?? Es de no creer. En serio.

Your writing is so eloquent for a 19yo.

I’ve been registered as a Democrat since I could vote. So since 2017.

To be fair, I was not following. Politics till after 2016.. started off with cnn and msnbc.. I thought wow I am soo informed and was like omg Rachel Maddox what a woman... but election season started and saw them smear bernie everyday... I realized how stupid I was and stopped .. so I get maybe why he got tricked

Oh I knew the policies in 2016. It was more of a matter of the campaign itself and the people that surrounded themselves around it. You know what I mean?

Yeah... I didn’t really find a problem with her comment. I still love her. She has said that she wants to restructure it.

https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/30/politics/elizabeth-warren-ice-immigration-protests/index.html

Her immigration plan is also good.

https://www.vox.com/2019/7/12/20690200/elizabeth-warren-immigration-proposal-2020

I don’t know if me defending her breaks some sort of rules here, but I don’t like the pitting progressives against each other thing that happens.

Kind of a long story. Let’s just say that I went through a period of immense stress and came out the other side a different person. And subreddits like r/circlebroke2 and r/GamerGhazi helped me with that transition.

Well I mean I already explained your last part. I think it’s because I was supporting Bernie the wrong way in 2016, and I didn’t like who I used to be. But now I figured out how to support him the right way.

And I’m still pretty young. I’m still being shaped by the world around me. And I’m still figuring out how to take in news, what news pieces to criticize, what articles to trust. Who’s writing what, the language they’re using. Media matters has really helped me with that. But it’s still a long process.

>Some people are just so gullible and malleable that they might as well not believe anything.

I have the same reaction at times.  So many people seem to support things that are god-awful and horrific, it seems amazing.  Wars, torture, hatred, murder and death. 

The only thing that makes this somewhat bearable is stories about people suddenly seeing the light, like this one.

It's not really rank gullibility though, there is a large powerful and effective network of disinformation out there, supporting right wing positions. The left is still years behind in that regard.

Well I'm 20, and my second major is English. But thank you.

Wonderful!

They didn't even occur to me... Of course live tv would give someone the wrong impression! I haven't watched tv since 2001 when it became obvious to me that 34% of tv was pushing ads and the other 66% was pushing narratives. I forget not everyone did the same thing...

Not really. I was there in 2016, the bernie bros in the negative context were a minority.   You seem to have been in a bubble inside another bubble, that is some crazy shit yo. Glad you are back.

People here have become more antagonistic of Warren because now she’s actually a “threat” to Bernie winning. It’s a defensive reaction, and I generally disagree with it. People are going to jump on you for liking her, so just shrug them off and ignore

[removed]

Yes, this is absolutely right.

At your age people tend to be trying out political identities and thus can change them pretty fast.

It's hard for some people to understand, but don't let them get you down.

We all have opinions our teens and early 20s that we look back on and cringe.

Yeap most of us just want what’s best for all of us just get tricked/ into an echo chamber that tell you this way or that way is the best way to save us

I didn't want to say this, because it might get me banned. But I explicitly remember this sub being full of those types. This sub is what led me down to that road. It didn't help that I was also watching Jimmy Dore and lunatics like that who believe in conspiracy theories and all of that. I was also a 4chan user. So, yeah I was in a bubble inside a bubble, but I think there were quite a few online people in that bubble with me.

I noticed that. When she was polling at like 3% earlier this year she was really liked on leftist spaces. And then now she’s hated.

If either Warren or Bernie get the nomination they will be the most progressive presidential nominee in history.

[removed]

I hadn't seen this sub until very recently. If it was as bad as you say, I'm impressed that is been turned around. Dumpster fires mostly stay dumpster fires.

I'm a little torn on this. No matter what I'm glad to have you back, don't mistake that at all!

But it is also frustrating to me to hear the dominance of the Bernie Bro trope yet again!

I wasn't a member of this sub in 2016, so I can't comment on what it was like back then. I was, however, a Bernie Sanders supporter in 2016...I'm also a woman and a feminist.

I did like Jimmy Dore in 2016 when he was at TYT, but when he started entertaining Seth Rich conspiracy theories...yeah, he lost me then. And, as for 4chan, I wouldn't touch that place with a 10 foot pole! 

So my experience was very different than yours, I think.

2016 was hard for me, though.

Having my existence erased, hearing icons like Gloria Stenheim say, let's be totally honest, sexist things about women like me, being condescended to and accused of trying to be a Cool Girl, even having friends from online feminist circles stop talking to me. I was even mansplained to by a male Clinton supporter in my family about the historical significance of the first woman President.

It sucked...and is why time around has been so vindicating.

Now, I'm not saying that there were/are no toxic Bernie supporters. As you said, all candidates, are going to have some toxic supporters. It's unavoidable.

What sucks, though, is that those are the voices that have been focused on in the media and ended up dominating 'our side'

Earlier this year, this sub basically had an “enemy of the month” thing going on, with Harris, Beto, Biden, and Pete all getting a turn. I think the disdain for Warren has persisted longer because she’s jumped up in polls and public opinion.

I think Bernie is the better candidate, but I recognize that a Warren presidency would be more progressive than anything we’ve had in decades (or ever?)

[removed]

Same here.

On this sub specifically, there were a lot of people saying Hillary was a cu** and a corporate wh***. 

There was a lot of high-five-ing when Clinton supporters were bullied into silence. It was an extremely toxic place. There were a lot of people saying that the Black people who supported Clinton were simply low information. And when Hillary won California, there were comments like “fucking Hispanics, how could you vote for the corporate wh***. Maybe Trump is right.” 

I’m not sure how it is now, but that is how it was. That stereotype was firmly met.

Probably ever. Because FDR was really progressive on the economic front. But socially he wasn’t. So if we have someone that is on the left on both economic and social issues, they would be the most progressive president ever.

>I think Bernie is the better candidate, but I recognize that a Warren presidency would be more progressive than anything we’ve had in decades

I can agree with this, though, not gonna lie, this campaign has actually diminished how Progressive I think Warren is.

As someone who was part of the draft Warren movement in 2014-2015, this has been very sad for me.

She's someone I really, really wanted to trust. I have ""Nevertheless, she persisted"" leggings and a t-shirt (I bought the leggings and then, coincidentally, was given the t-shirt for my birthday a week later)!

She makes it so hard, though.

During the month that she was in the race and Bernie wasn't, I tried hard to convince myself that I thought she was just as good as Bernie and could make it and win against Trump.

However, when Bernie entered I felt so relieved...and that made it obvious what my gut was really telling me.

Since then, unfortunately, nothing has happened to convince me I was wrong about that.

What's disappointed me the most about Warren is the super PACs during the general issue because I feel that reasoning leads to the ""I'll start my diet on Monday"" trap, and how she's gone back and forth on M4A.

I don't hate her, but I do perceive her as a lot less progressive than I did before 2019.

I'll have no problem voting for her against Trump, though!

I believe you.

My point was more of that the stereotype might have been met at this sub, but that wasn't actually the entirety of Bernie's support...but we were all accused of that.
And for those of us who weren't white male dudebros, that really sucked!

You haven’t kept up with news. Warren said she wasn’t gonna say no to fundraisers during the general, not that she’d accept super PACs. But that doesn’t matter anymore because she says that she’s not gonna do fundraisers for the general and is gonna keep the fundraising model she has now.

The Medicare for all thing has been exhausting. She wasn’t going back and forth, she’s not Kamala Harris. She simply said that there are other measures that she does support. But she said that “she’s with Bernie in Medicare for All.” She even got a bunch of economists to figure out a way to pay for Medicare for All. She’s not backing away from that. I don’t know why you say she’s having a back and forth when it’s clear where she stands.

I disagree on the assessment that she hasn't gone back and forth on M4A, but it's okay. We can agree to disagree on that.

As I said, I'm not saying I hate Warren. I don't.

I just peg her as a little more toward center than I would have in 2016-2018.

I'd still be happy if she became President, though.

And I’m just saying comments like that which aren’t accurate, she was getting piled on by the press and moderates because of her support of Medicare for all, comments like that even if you don’t intend it add to the Bernie or Bust mentality of a lot of people.

Even if you say you’ll vote for her in the general. Plus since that’s a year away and you said you like her less now, there’s a possibility that you will start hating her by then and start spreading more lies maybe even start calling her a neoliberal and stuff like that. Especially if you continue to hang out here a lot.

I don’t know who you are and you might not do this, but I’ve been down this road before. I know where it typically leads.

Wow, okay.

I'm not lying about anything. She did say that she'd be open to other options besides Medicare for All. 
If you feel that's not big deal, fair enough.
It worries me though and I have just as much right to feel that way as you to do say that it doesn't worry you.

And, no I'm not going to start hating her by election day!

Firstly, because I'm not 16. I'm in my 30s. I know who I am and what I stand for.

Secondly, because I want Trump gone first and foremost!
I voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016 even though I definitely had Trump supporters trying to trick me into the idea that Trump was more like Bernie.
It was incredibly transparent, though, and I wasn't fooled for a minute into thinking that Trump was serious about universal healthcare. Plus, there was the issue of his racism!
I didn't even hate Hillary Clinton on election day 2016, and she's far more conservative and problematic than Warren!

As for helping the Bernie or Bust mentality...I would suggest that attacking me and saying that I'm a liar just for mildly disagreeing with you on Elizabeth Warren will also contribute to that mentality.
I know who I'll vote for no matter what you or anyone else says to me, but other people will see this and be influenced by how open they perceive Warren supporters being.

Not to mention the Bernie or Bust thing largely didn't come true. The vast majority of Bernie supporters voted for Clinton.

I'm not your enemy, and I don't think you're mine. We want the same thing. A Progressive President. Bernie would be best, but if it's Warren she would be better than anyone up until now!

Whoa man. Not cool to generalize people and accuse them of ""potentially in the future make false attacks on someone."" You can't view everyone as coming from a malicious place. You may have been in that sort of place in the past, but it doesn't mean everyone else is. I get that you're defensive as a Warren and Sanders supporter on a Sanders sub, and that's cool. I used to donate to Warren too. There's going to be people that don't like that, but don't frame others as bad actors.

I don’t know who you are and you might not do this.

Exactly, so do not make baseless accusations please.

I realize it's been 2 years but you're only 19, now seems like a good time to get out of a relationship with someone that is now a fundamentally different person.

Yes I have, but she says “you don’t understand how it feels and you never will because you have it all good in life” and she just dismisses me.

Yeah, this girl is beyond help then IMO. If you don't want to deal with her unreasonable BS anymore, then you can always move on from the relationship.

What injustices does she herself face daily? What a moron.

None actually, the only time she (well I) was pulled over was when a lazy cop gave me a ticket for “running a red light” even though it was green, but that was a year ago and I was the one driving while she was sitting in the passenger seat

In the months after the release, we had a hectic schedule of book talks at venues ranging from Alabama Department of Archives & History in Montgomery and the Caroline Marshall Draughon Center for the Arts & Humanities in Auburn to libraries and churches around Alabama. The most recent event was at the History Museum of Mobile for their Learning Lunch series.

*Closed Ranks*tells the latter-day story of the Whitehurst Case, a police-shooting controversy in Montgomery, Alabama in the mid-1970s. The victim, Bernard Whitehurst, Jr. was a 33-year-old African-American man, married and a father of four, who worked as a janitor at a McDonald's restaurant and part-time at a church near his home. Although initial reports claimed that Whitehurst had shot first at the officer who killed him, it was later charged that he did not have a gun that day and that the gun lying next to his body had been placed there by police. Inquiries led by the Montgomery district attorney and the Whitehurst family's attorney uncovered a range of inconsistencies and irregularities, yet in the end, no officers faced criminal penalties related to his death, and a federal civil lawsuit failed in its cause. By the time the Whitehurst Case was over in the late 1970s, the victim's family had been denied justice for his wrongful death.

*Closed Ranks*, which was written as a first-person narrative of my search for the truth, asks long-range questions about race, policing, governance, and justice in the post-Civil Rights era, questions which are still pertinent today. I spent the years 2013 through 2017 working with some members of the Whitehurst family to tell the story of Whitehurst Case and of the family's pursuit of justice in the decades since, and the book was published by NewSouth Books in 2018.  *The Crime Report*'s David Krajicek wrote that *Closed Ranks*takes ""the first long retrospective look at the case, whose racial overtones resonate today in the #BlackLivesMatter movement,"" and the Alabama Writers Forum's review called the book ""a powerful and methodical memoir."" It was an honor to write about this crucial albeit neglected aspect of Montgomery's history, and it has been a continued honor to share this story with audiences over the last year.

I can tell you're serious because you work as a security guard but God damn if you think the Eric Garner case was ""horse shit"" you're an asshole, even Bill O'Reilly thought it was injustice

You're making a lot of blanket/generic claims so its hard to agree with you. Sure, campus activism can be frustrating sometimes but they're often for legitimate reasons. I don't think I would categorize it as all a load of horse shit lol.

zzz

I mean he was non compliant and assaulted a police officer. That and he robbed a store and choked the owner. What are your reasons for thinking otherwise?

And you're right about the asshole part but I don't appreciate your attack ad hominem. That just makes you look like bad dude.

*mostly a load of horse shit then

Did you really mix up Michael Brown and Eric Garner?

Yes lol. My mistake. 

My stance is still the same. Garner should've complied. Plenty of people get thrown around in head locks and chokeholds all the time and end up just fine. I see it still the time in grappling matches and when people get rowdy at clubs and bars. Sucks that garner, at 40 years old, could not survive a 10 second chokehold from someone a quarter of his weight.

What's the end goal here? Should cops be allowed to chokehold everyone who questions their authority? What level of bootlicking is this?

Cops should be allowed to chokehold anyone who is non compliant and resistant to lawful orders and where appropriate. What would you have done? Got on your hands and knees and begged him to comply?

No chokeholds for any unarmed nondangerous suspect is a very basic start.

dude you need to actually go to another country.  Literally no cop in Europe is going to fucking chokehold you. You're a fucking psycho if you think that's something cops should be allowed to do.

So what about if armed? Against a knife or a gun? Chokeholds are okay then? Let's see you do it.

&#x200B;

Second, homeboy was twice the size of any other PO there at the time. You may not think it but physical altercations, even unarmed, can lead to serious and permanent injury or even death. Again, the chokehold is a legitimate and viable means of restraint that has been used more times than you can imagine to subdue an individual. If you can offer up a better alternative for that specific incident I'd like to hear it.

Cops in Europe also don't have to deal with the same problems as the US. There's a huge difference in attitudes both culturally and socially between the two nations. Europe also engages in a much more severe systematic bias against other races and outsiders, and is even more exploitive of women and cheap labor in general. 

What works for Europe doesn't work in the US. Just like what works in Afghanistan doesn't work in Japan. You say chokeholds don't happen in Europe, I can find you a video of a teenage girl getting beat with a metallic baton from the Netherlands that happened this year. All cops must resort to force when non physical efforts have been exhausted.

Yeah the better alternative is no cops lol, I offered the most milquetoast compromise and you rejected it because you're a bootlicker.

Really weird that cops in England don't chokehold you even if you threaten with a knife.  They talk you down.  It's not as if they face a different world of threats.  They're just trained better and have a culture of service to the community.

Just because you love our cops carrying guns and choking people out doesn't actually make us safer.  It just adds risk to every interaction and lets cops powertrip all the time.

Name calling, twice now. Thanks for admitting you lost and have nothing wise worthwhile to offer. The very best that SEAS'19 has to offer.

No cop would chokehold someone with a knife - that is the absolute worst position to put yourself in as a cop. But regardless, chokeholds do happen in England whether or not you see or hear it on the news and don't delude yourself into thinking otherwise. Go work at any club or bar as a bouncer and it's only a matter of time. 

Again, police in the UK are not dealing with the same people as the US. Take any department there and put them in a local New York police precinct and there's a good likelihood they'll end up the same way. No amount of training can change that. 

Lastly, ""talking"" can only do so much. I hope the day never comes when you need a cop to utilize physical force in order to save your life, and instead opts to ""talk"" with the guy assaulting you and rubbing your face into the concrete pavement.

I lived in England and felt safer than I do in NYC.  People here are exactly the same as there.  NYC doesn't even have many guns.

You're fooling yourself if you think NYPD behavior is anything other than abusive.  They're incompetent, trained worse than their european counterparts, and basically a bunch of fuck ups that get off on abusing their power.  

European cops often do come to the US to see our heavily militarized police and basically make fun of us.  Not only do we have far worse crime rates despite being far richer than the EU - we also imprison far more people.  The entire system is a joke.  And defending it makes zero sense.

It makes zero sense to generalize an entire police force as better or worse than the other. The fact that England has lower crime and incarceration rates than the US has more to do with the fact that attitudes and behavior amongst the British is nowhere near as violent, reckless, belligerent, or dangerous as the US. And the fact you think it has any relation to the way police treat them is ludicrous. Japan has lower crime and incarceration rates than England,  does that mean they're a better police force? Tibet has even lower crime and incarceration rates, does that mean they have a better police force? 

British police would never be able to successfully police new York or any other state or city in the US without adopting the same policies.

NSFW ASIAN SUBS like /r/AsianAmericanPorn /r/WhiteMenRuletheWorld and /r/AsianGirlsforWhiteMen have been trending in the NSFW category.

*edit: https://subredditstats.com/r/Teachinginkorea 

While /r/ AsianAmerican is stagnant in followers, NSFW Asian subs and specific Asian Country subs have increased 2-3.5x the past YEAR alone.

It is clear that Reddit is anti China and anti Asian males as we see the continuous racist remarks and statements in the comments about The Chinese people and Asian men.  (Every excuse has been used to justify these racist comments, “Chinese government” “its true Asians are racist” “they deserved to be roped”)

We are seeing a growing number of white males who spend most of the time online, watching anime, watching code tutorials, gossiping about the Chinese, eating sushi or Chinese take out everyday, writing up manifestos about Asians, and see the disgruntled and angry side of these folks when you call them out on their blatant racism about Asians. 

They play victim and act like they did nothing wrong , see those articles in Thailand 🇹🇭 and the Philippines 🇵🇭 of wm going on tirades and then act like a baby when caught?

We have “ESL Teachers” in Japan and Korea that wouldn’t have gotten an official teaching job in the States that have some fetish about young Asian school girls while abusing young Asian boys verbally and sometimes physically.

Why are there so many of these people in Asia?

You think they’d act like this in the streets of Los Angeles or NYC? Would they have creeped on Muslim school girls or Blacks? Just Asians right?

What made them flee their homes and live out a disturbing fantasy about Asians?

Do their parents know how they behave?

Why aren’t their prominent Asian activist that never speak up on these issues ? They’re just parroting about China and how Andrew Yang shouldn’t represent Asian Americans.

Yet here we are with the numbers still increasing and the hateful rhetoric about Asians continues,

I won’t be surprised if most of these people who cheer for #FREEHONGKONG didn’t support #BlackLivesMatter or #Lgbtq 

They’re masquerading their intentions by a viral movement and use it as an excuse to attack Chinese, Our culture, and their #1 enemy, Asian males.","Asian Countries exploit their own yet welcome foreigners with red carpet. Social awareness of a peanut.

DEPORT THE WHITES 

SEND THEM BACK

WHITES DON'T BELONG HERE

This is my number one concern. Asia needs to close it's doors and severely restrict ESL positions to true teachers (people who have degrees in education).

> Why are there so many of these people in Asia? 

Bottom line - local demand.  There's videos of offspring of WMAF with an english last name going to teach english in Asia.  They find themselves discriminated against by the schools due to parents preferring a white teacher.  The end game is to make them quit as they aren't in as much demand regardless of them being native english speakers.   


I'm not sure this will change much unless said country becomes really good at english.  At that point they can reasonably judge the skills of a teacher based on substance instead of them being white.

>I won’t be surprised if most of these people who cheer for #FREEHONGKONG didn’t support #BlackLivesMatter or #Lgbtq 

I won't be surprised if these people don't even support Asians in the west.

And at home here in the US, as the fear of a prolonged recession is looming (loss of jobs, decrease in manufacturing numbers, inverted bond cross, employment numbers slowing down, public pension funding stressed, interest rates essentially going to zero, asset values at its peak or near peak, not being able to make ends meet, not being able to pay debts, home loss, etc) coupled with the China hate and general racist environment, more fuel will be added to taking it out on Asian Americans at home.  Just saying don’t be surprised and don’t be taken off guard.  We’ve seen the turmoil in the 1980s with the Japan bashing culture here when similar conditions were seen.  But I think this time the scale is bigger as the fight for a new world order with Asia on top is imminent.

white western world has lost their homeland according to some. influx of migrants and what they perceive as the destruction of their traditional power base at the top. ALL asian nations should make sure that low level people like this stay out of the continent. its fine to welcome STEM people because they are high quality and have value but the vast majority are low quality esl type's and should be literally banned from entering any asian nation.the same goes for bloggers who exploit stereotypes to make youtube money. identify, call out, and then revoke visa . simple process

the onus is on Asian governments to raise standards and stem this tide. Imagine letting some Walmart greeter be an educator for your country's children. Just pathetic. 

the average WM still gets the red carpet treatment in all Asian countries. taht's just a fact. Until this stops, the WMs will keep going.

#freehongkong is a litmus test for retardation at this point

r/AsianAmericanPorn is full of WMAF. Then the one Asian male video I see on there has comments about how strange the pairing is and of course the usual racial slurs and penis jokes. I'm convinced that it's a sub for white men who fetishise Asian women but want their Asian women to speak English only, lol. 

Well, I guess it says a lot about how the sexuality of Asian-American women vs. Asian-American men are viewed. Don't get gaslighted - many Redditors are racists and particularly Sinophobes but won't admit it even when it's blatantly obvious to anyone who isn't deadlocked into this ""west is best"" mentality.

because east asian males don't defend themselves enough.

Asia is the only place that allows untalented white people to get jobs just because they're western. There must be demand from Asia for these western foreigners too. But many Asians can't speak good English, like many Japanese people in Japan, so they're not doing much in reality and the society doesn't really care I guess.

There's nothing i hate more than some losers going to some Asian country and exploiting the local kindness and naivety to shit on Asian.

You can know what WM think about white and asian relationship just by typing WMAF, most of that shit is NSFW

Makes sense, there is a growing movement of digital nomad parasite bullshit and losers who feel like white men are opressed in west and run away to asia or south america or EE to cope with being a subhuman reject and a lot of these people are very similar in terms of political opinions and entitled western mindset. More people need to be aware of them and be dealt with.

Asia will be an LBH paradise.

i'm surprised those subreddits with racist undertones are not banned.

I never had a a problem dating or getting laid? Why go to Asia anyway? I live near Koreatown in LA. You want to see somebody struggling to get laid in the USA. Korean men are in much worse shape.

That seems to be a common theme of all previously-colonised countries. The locals were/are kind to the westerners and treated the westerners as equals, however, the westerners never viewed the locals as equals nor accepted this status - they wanted to take advantage of the locals and saw themselves as superior.

Most parents in China would like to see foreign (white) faces teaching their kids. Schools also prefer foreign (white) looking teachers so they would seem more legitimate and marketable. I have seen instances where Asian Americans get rejected by ESL companies at job fairs whilst Eastern Europeans who can barely speak English get hired on the spot.

They should start hiring more overseas-educated Asians. As time goes on and there are more and more Asians speaking fluent English returning to their home countries, people there will realise that it doesn't take someone with blonde hair and blue eyes to teach their children good English. In fact, an overseas Asian will probably do a better job because they can explain the content in the student's native language.

Being in a non-english speaking country as an english speaker and knowing lots of expats that rely on their native language as a way to obtain an ESL position, I do not support this.

I've observed that the quality of teacher they turnout to be is often reflective of the type of person they  are, themselves. The ones that remain usually are the good teachers and they are quite successful in their position with student, teacher, and parent feedback. The good ones accomplished this even without higher education or certification and this is the only reason I don't support this.

For these individuals, their native language let them live in another country and become self sustaining while experiencing another country and culture. I feel that this is worth some consideration.

As far as a country controlling the quality of their Government Provided/Established education plan, that's their business.

That's indeed an unfortunate stereotype, which as you say stems from parents not understanding English themselves so being unable to judge an English teacher by anything other than whether they look ""foreign"" enough. But I find that stereotype is fast dying out as there are more people like us (western-educated Asians) who can speak English natively. When our fellows in Asia meet us they see that you don't need a blonde haired blue eyed person to teach you good English. In fact, when I was in school many of the highest-achieving students in English were Asian. I think it's something to do with being bilingual which makes us more aware of how to use language.

\#freehongkong hahahaha. They're 22 years too late for that!

The hong kong rioters literally called lebron the n word while lynching a depiction of him lol.

The notion that asians are racist against black people is true sometimes. Those hong kong rioters are some shining example of it.

The difference is this time they are losing. They beat Japan (twice), they beat the Soviet Union. But China isn't Japan or the Soviet Union and the America of today is not the America of the 20th century. This time they find they're not as exceptional as they thought. They're trying the same old dirty tricks on China - trade wars, colour revolutions, media fear-mongering - and it's not working out. At some point they'll have to confront the fact they can't go on walking over everybody and still stay on top, and it's a hard truth to swallow.

Without a doubt there has been a marked noticeable shift in an awareness of global economic issues. Some people choose to get enlightened and say where do I fit in the puzzle of everything happening. 

There is quite a bit of just willful ignorance going on from people who are just clueless about the intersectionality of economics and culture. 

People who are ignorant are going to further insinuate their racist narrow minded rhetoric while losing ever more economic ground - on a global scale. 

I don’t know what the ultimate outcomes will be. But I do think there will be a breaking point when people realize there is no going back... I think it’s a positive thing as things are shifting and changing so fast.

🙏 this.

white men with low or no credentials dont go to SEA to teach. They go to have easy sex with girls and underages girls and bully the boys

>the average WM still gets the red carpet treatment in all Asian countries. taht's just a fact. Until this stops, the WMs will keep going.

There is just something so wrong about this. White men go to Asia and get treated with curiosity and reverence, Asian men go to the western world and get treated rudely and called terrible names. I think it stems from the etiquette of many Asian countries of treating guests graciously, which will typically be reciprocated, but in the case of these shitty expats they don't respect the local culture and take advantage of this kindness. It's the age-old white supremacy and arrogance rearing its ugly head.

> the onus is on Asian governments to raise standards 

Hasn't both Korea and China done this to varying levels in the past?

I hope they do it even more.

Pretty hard to do when western countries still hold diplomatic power over your government.

Take hong kong, for example.

More like a litmus test for ignorance. I feel bad for these people, they're frogs at the bottom of the well eating up a bunch of biased garbage from MSM, yet they think we are the brainwashed ones, lol. 

And for the record, Hong Kong was already freed 22 years ago when they removed the British invaders that massacred 220,000 of our people and stole Hong Kong.

Asians in asia are oblivious to racism because they have always been the majority.

I think it's to do with economic hierarchy tbh. For example, if you are a mediocre businessman from China or Japan in India, or Bangladesh, you will get a lot more business opportunities than a good local businessman. It's like that all over the world unfortunately.

it already is. to the delight of Asian females who are can't wait to raise a ""混血儿"" and become the envy of their friends.

Can we report to Reddit to have those groups removed?

I never had a problem fucking blonde girls, seems like guys like you do tho 😂 

A failed published has to brag about having sex with a korean?

Pathetic 

Nice try

I don’t blame you, there’s a lot of statistics about Asians that are completely made up by 4chan racist dweebs to discredit the truth about their real intentions in Asia.

Anyways,

I used 

https://subredditstats.com/r/Teachinginkorea
 
To compare the subreddits and as you and I can see, these subs have increased 2-3.5x the past year.

I’ve also noted on my research that most Asian subs are not moderated by Asian Males. 

It’s moderated by white male users who have a fascination with White Identity politics & East Asian Culture, judging from their overall Reddit posts.

You can use that website to compare the NSFW sites too but there other resources to look at the micro data about these users more specifically.

And if you see what I see, it’s daunting how these real human beings view Asia as an adult playground.

I’m sure you’re Asian buddy.

you sound like a mgtow from the looks of your profile 

go learn history and come back, whites from europe and america have white privilege and economic leverage over asian countries that even if they're an incel, loser dropout they can come to asia with their saved up money from working minimum wage and still be able to live comfortably than the average asian. that's not even mentioning them exploiting asians and using asian girls for sex while looking down on the asian people.

And somehow i was called a racist at /r/indonesia for pointing out that we have a 10:1 racial wage gap.

Which is fucking stupid. Both the white and Asian employers are guilty of anti-Asian discrimination.

Yep this is the problem. It's institutionalized white worship.

Just graduate from college and get get a teaching certificate before heading out to Asia.

The non-Asians that remain in Asia to teach English are usually the ones that can't compete in the US job market.

Sorry, but I don't give a shit about your anecdotes. A look through your post history shows your concern trolling and ""noble defense"" of white men.

I understand our college system is fucked up but there is no shortage of people who can teach english well and unemployment is always going to be a thing. Higher ed isnt for everyone but stringent requirements and background checks are for educators. Teachers in training have people sit in their lessons to evaluate their efficacy and professionalism. If an educational institution can put them up in housing, they can at least do that. If not, then they should go for a cheaper option, i.e. someone who has already been vetted by virtue of having a degree/cert in their target language and education.

>The ones that remain usually are the good teachers and they are quite successful in their position with student, teacher, and parent feedback. 

Those locals are just forced to pick the cleanest shit out of a pile of diarrhea

LeBron has every rights to not support the Hong Kong riot. He is Black-American, he know what he's been through. And seeing all the white people and Hong Kong rioters shitting on him is pathetic

There already hit a breaking point, there is not rewinding of this global economy. Managed decline is what it is. 

This sub bashes white people a lot, but we also have to remember Asian Americans have the number 1 income inequality in the US, even counting those crazy rich whites, we are already leaving our own brothers behind, in the US.

yes in most cases. but i believe se's will not tolerate it any longer. i see pushback in vavrious stories. i hope sea's clamp down on it

>Sorry, but I don't give a shit about your anecdotes. A look through your post history shows your concern trolling and ""noble defense"" of white men.

My observation is that a person will immediately try to discredit me with accusations of trolling or personal attacks when they are not able to discuss the topic of the thread. Notice that you immediate avoided everything you mentioned and my response to it to just attack specific things about me. 

Maybe this is an attempt to deflect or distract?

Regardless, your concerns are valid concerns and I would like to take the time to address them and clarify. If something is unclear or not true, then point them out.

>1.Not knowing / bothering to looking up what the bamboo ceiling is despite being ""Asian""

Yes, it's true. I actually didn't know anything about the bamboo ceiling an my reckless searching of the term led me incorrect information.[I didn't know what it was, I admitted that I was not familiar, I thanked the poster for correcting me and I improved my knowledge and awareness](https://np.reddit.com/r/aznidentity/comments/dj37tk/chinese_nypd_cop_commits_suicide_due_to_workplace/f421ly9?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x). Would you rather me just ignore it?

I also found more references in the AI guidelines and did some continued research. I feel I have a better understanding.

>2.Refusing to see the hypocrisy of Western media when looking at the HK protests vs. Catalonia

This is kinda hard to address because it got multiple replies and [one really good discussion](https://np.reddit.com/r/aznidentity/comments/dj5ow4/free_hk_movement_on_reddit_is_sickening/f46rxhh?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x). I did not say there 'no hypocrisy'. I also said I had a healthy distrust of all media, which is why I try to cross-reference them with each other. I also methods to approach all information that can help with determining the validity of a source, article, or video.

I [also asked fo](https://np.reddit.com/r/aznidentity/comments/dj5ow4/free_hk_movement_on_reddit_is_sickening/f45moyx?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)r any other sources of information if anyone had it. I am always looking to improve my sources of information.

>3.Maybe you really aren't Asian after all

my words "" **I'm not going to argue my race, because this is the internet. I can make  a claim about myself but i'm not willing to provide any proof of it,  for anonymity. I also don't think that my race is the topic of  discussion and your focus on it might be a distraction tactic. We can  end this now.** ""

Since that post, I have submitted a verification image and was approved.

>4.Most WMAFs don't concern themselves with race huh?

again, better if i quote myself in that comment "" I don't agree with the wording of this statement. WMAF **can be** a symptom of white worship **but is it not exclusively** a result of white worship. In, I'm assuming most cases of US raised adults, wmaf couplings don't concern themselves with race. ""

Notice that I bolded ""can be"" and ""not exclusively"" with a followup of ""i'm assuming \[...\] US raised adults"".

Also, I chose that one phrase to reply to because the person who made the post had lots of good points and information.

\--

Please let me know which and why my comments are evidence of concern trolling and defending white men. I do have actual concern, so I can understand a suspicious of the genuinity of concern. I don't see any evidence of defending white men, though. can you point that out?

All great points and valid recommendations!

You're not wrong, but isn't that what all countries do to their own citizens? Just look at the entry level jobs and how many of those that held the entry level position and moved on to more senior positions.

This hurts /s

You're right to have an opinion based on emotions is fully supported.

If you want to make an actual accusation of me being a troll, please provide the links to my comments that confirm my trollish behavior. This shouldn't be hard for someone of your caliber.

Let me remind you that just because someone disagrees with your ideas does not mean they are doing it just out of spite (trolling) to elicit a specific emotional response. Accusing someone of being a troll without supporting arguments or evidence is more reflective of the accuser and how they try to shield themselves from an actual discussion that might challenge their own opinions.

Speak English buddy.

wtf ru even talking about. trying to sound smart by throwing words you don't understand. you're an uncle chan bro just stfu if you don't understand what we're talking about. colonialism and imperialism has real world consequences, they literally crippled asian countries economies and some are still recovering from that while the whites built themselves up from our spoils.

i'm literally just advocating against the exploitation of asian people and asian women. the dregs of white society going to asia to ""re-invent"" themselves is not a new concept. i'm not sure if you're stupid or just a cuck. either way you're prolly some pussy little asian guy that smiles gleefully when whites call you a chink. you prolly think they're your friends LOL

This is not a joke but at my previous company I had to show 2 clients around who were visiting from a top law firm in New York and one of them was a nerdy-looking white/Jewish guy whose only stint after law school was teaching English in Japan for 2 years. I was so confused...like...how did he go from teaching English to working at a top law firm?? White privilege is magic for white people.

What did this house gook said? He’s speaking in indonesian. 

He said:

“Of course i’m an asian. What, do you think javanese are white?”

bro 😎💪

So we’re throwing racist asian remarks now?

Now that’s very smart from a guy who said he advocated “against the exploitation of asian people and asian women” by using racist asian remarks to a fellow asian.

I mean come on man, how deep are you in circlejerk by not looking yourself at the mirror before posting shit like stereotype in r/asianamerican. It’s funny to consider yourself as this “advocates” while throwing fellow asian “under the bus”.

Sure, colonialism and imperialism has it share in making China a totalitarian dictatorship, South East Asian as sweatshops, India plagued by ultra-nationalism due to its division which empowered a sense of “nation state” (very western concept btw), and  of course, “self-appointing advocate like yourself” who’s busy in creating negative imaging of white people instead of “educating normality and acceptance”.

I’m not sure if you’re stupid or just a cuck but you prolly got choked deep by the upvotes of your circlejerks LOL.

Also, why no one brought up the neo-imperialism practice of PRC in Africa? That’s a very “white” idea to use you know.

and how are you being exploited by me lol? do you have difficulty with reading comprehension? are you retarded? i called you an uncle chan because you are an uncle chan. coming out of the woodwork to defend sexpats like a well trained house slave. white people are already thought of as educated, well meaning, rich people. they already have a good image in asia you thick cunt. that's the point. they have white privilege. you could speak english just as good or better than some white guy with a highschool degree and he'd get hired over you. holy fuck it's no wonder asia is so fucking pathetic and cucked to the nth degree. we have actual spastic retards that don't have any critical thinking capacity. you think you're some progressive asian unlike all these ""racist backwards asians"" lol, go read up respectability politics you fucking clown. people like you are the reason why asians are mentally colonised and continue to be so. you can't accept reality so you take on this mantle of being some enlightened asian. come back to reality retard.

> Also, why no one brought up the neo-imperialism practice of PRC in Africa? That’s a very “white” idea to use you know.

You ever used tokopedia, bukalapak or shopee?

Do you know who supplied those sites with source code and infrastructure? Do you know the reason why online payment these days are easy unlike in the past?

Ever realize the similarity of all 3 sites i mentioned with aliexpress?

That is one example of PRC’s “neocolonialism”

Their “neocolonialism” built an industry, empower house industries.

Now compare it with what america did in papua. How they massacred our papuan brothers. How they turned them against us by hiding under their new order puppet. How they leveled an entire mountain and took USD 40bil worth of mined minerals every year.

I don’t think you understand what “neocolonialism” means.

Now this is why I said the people here are like MGTOW.

Do you even read what you just type?

Really come on, do you read what you type in whatever are you using to type on right now?

Is this what a freakin “advocates” would say to a person? (And even degrading the people that he “advocates”).

Go back to reality fella LOL.

LOL you're a pathetic kuck.

I ain’t that preaching pragmatism towards racism nor the guy that express culture difference as racist.

Are there any hashtag movements that you feel have had a big impact? I'm guessing there is nothing that has taken off on such a huge scale due to the comparatively small size of the trans community and the trans-exclusionary media's failure to equal voice to  trans activism (when they are not attacking it). However, I think awareness of trans issues has still grown a lot in recent years and I was wondering if there were any big social media movements that you would say have contributed towards this. 

Edit: I have come across #translivesmatter but I have no idea how widespread this was","The best one I can think of is the Hbomberguy stream, which lead to the ""X Says Trans Rights"" meme, which has led to a lot of celebrity personalities publicly supporting us.

I'm not sure hashtag activism has been that big for us. We saw a lot of awareness spread through traditional media (particularly with Laverne Cox and Orange Is The New Black, and, sadly, Caitlyn Jenner). Online, awareness came mostly from Youtube and articles in places like Medium. I remember seeing a lot of educational articles from Sam Dylan Finch early on.

We've made big gains just living our lives in public view. We have successful politicians, scientists, doctors, actors, film makers, journalists, novelists (including a recent Nebula winner), musicians, and more. Despite the sensationalism, everyone who comes out helps to normalize transness and make it just another thing a person can be.

Not sure if this would be relevant to your paper, but the general penetration of Japanese media definitely helped me accept myself as trans. I grew up in a very conservative part of the US, ""where men are men and women are women"". Because I just didn't do well with my assigned role, I wound up escaping to the Internet a lot, and it also was where anime was, which I like quite a lot. Latched onto the whole 'trap' thing, and eventually used it to explore media that allowed for far more gender-nonconforming behavior than I thought was possible, or even legal. 
From there I discovered trans-positive Reddit, and later Discord, and used them to move across the country to a far more accepting space irl.

Social movements had little to do with it in the beginning. It was the work a many dedicated and incredibly brave individuals. I watched it happen.

To be real, this sub was my first and by far biggest step in those early days.  My main profile is now the throw away I used to keep the folks I knew IRL on my other account from figuring me out lol.  I found a lot of solidarity in reading through other people figuring their shit out.

[deleted]

I don't have a Twitter account, so definitely take this with a grain of salt, but my impression is that the influencers most instrumental in spreading trans awareness and acceptance have been YouTubers. ContraPoints, Hbomberguy, Kat Blaque, and Ash Hardell are all trans or pro-trans activists with 500k+ subscribers; I'm sure I'm missing a few big ones, but im mostly familiar with the more left-leaning voices of the community.

As mentioned previously in the thread, Hbomberguy might have been one of the more successful at spreading positivity outside the trans community, both through the ""X says Trans Rights"" thing and the $500k DK speedrun stream for a transgender children's charity.

If I had to name two people to look into, I'd probably say ContraPoints and Hbomberguy.

Lazy

Including Doom Guy and Donkey Kong right?

Thanks. I hadn't come across this one. I'll do some more research around it.

I didn't think hashtag activism had been big, but I was worried I was missing something. I'd be interested to learn more about why that might been. One of my participants mentioned how much of an impact Caitlyn Jenner had. I forgot about OITNB but thanks for reminding me. I am more interested in grassroots movements started by ordinary trans people rather than awareness generated by the mass media and celebs, so the activistm on YouTube and Medium would be a great example.

It is actually. I am writing a section on how the internet is great for exploring, community building and accessing support for LGBTQIA+ people, particularly when we are isolated from other LGBTQIA+ offline like yourself. Thanks for sharing :-)

That's great to here. It's so good these spaces exist. Im not trans but before I came out as gay, the internet was so important for me to come to terms with who I was. I dread to think what life was like pre internet!

Amazing, thanks. This is actually really relevant because I am especially interested in movements that had an impact offline. I hadn't heard of this because I'm in Europe but it's a nice example of the power of social media :-)

Surely it's better that I ask actually trans people about this rather than do my own research (as a cis person) and end up talking about movements that are not that relevant, or  are relevant but not representative of all trans people. I  researched the question before coming here, hence my mentioning #translivesmatter. However, as a cis person, I am less connected to this stuff so I wanted to make sure the things I was finding were important to a diverse group of trans people.

Cool! One of the things that happens with Youtube, in particular, is that trans people get very invested in making helpful videos and doing activism there while they're transitioning, then tend to peter out after they're done and living their lives post-transition. So you may find a lot of defunct accounts that used to have a ton of videos up. Kat Blaque is a recent counterexample; she continues despite being well into her post-transition phase. You might also look up Aaron Ansuini and Chase Ross, who used to have a great trans-centered podcast/vlog series called You're So Brave.

Relevant to this (but not much to activism) is the world of fanfiction. I know not everyone likes it but fanfic is a place where a lot of young people can experiment and read up about gender and sexuality. Particularly relevant mentions that come to mind are the Sherlock fandom (there's a whole subcategory of Sherlock fanfic called translock, which is how I came to learn about transness being a thing) and recently the Good Omens tv show has seen a lot of people experimenting with nb identities. Also a lot of fanfic communities become safe spaces for lgbt/questioning people. I hope I didn't digress too much from your area of interest, if so I'm sorry

EDIT: spelling

Thank you so much for all this info. I'll check those people out.  I wonder why they become less active post-transition? Do you think it's because are more  comfortable in themselves  and feel less need to be active?

Yeah -- transition is A LOT while it's happening, but afterward you're just living your life in your gender like everyone else. And honestly I think people who reach the point where they're cis passing can start to feel less urgency about the political stuff. It's hard to care about bathroom bills as much when nobody's ever going to challenge you for using the bathroom.

I wanted the Wii U (the Wii Unity) to do what the Wii did in the console generation before. You know, when that little engine that could TROUNCED their Big Money, Big Graphics competitors Sony's PlayStation 3 & Microsoft's XBox 360.  
Just like humble Nintendo's DS handheld did to arrogant Sony's PlayStation Portable with all of its horsepower & funding.

Then-126 year old **Nintendo** might have been **""Dad""** to the industry but it was the Underdog in this Console War against **Sony the once-King of Electronics** & **Microsoft the King of Computers**. And with the Smartphone Revolution disrupting the entire videogame console industry, Nintendo is ALSO taking on **Apple the Original King of Computers** & **Google/Alphabet the King of the World Wide Web**. That's 4 Corporate BEHEMOTHS with multiple product lines & income streams taking on essentially an overgrown Mom-and-Pop shop. I call Nintendo a Mom-and-Pop Corporation.  
Its impact is WAY outsized compared to its core structure. It's STILL a playing card/toy company at the end of the day.  
They only make the bulk of their money from one business: videogames. Playing cards & toys are supplemental.  
And of that videogame business they only have a Twin Dragon lineup at one time: Home Consoles & Handheld Consoles.  
They only survive these monsters by doing what they do so well. It's astounding they have survived all these years really.

And Nintendo seemed to be turning a corner ever since Super Smash Bros. for 3DS & Wii U came out at the end of 2014.  
Their oddball **amiibo** idea took off like hotcakes! Toy company/Playing Card company roots strike again.  
What Nintendo lacked in horsepower, they made up a hundred fold in charm. Neither Sony, Microsoft, Apple, or Google could pull off the out-of-left-field ideas Nintendo does. When everybody scratches their head & goes 'huh?' when they don't get it, Nintendo dares to do the impossible & make it work. Nintendo might be a corporation but it ain't faceless.  
That company got HEART & SOUL. Everytime someone says ***""Nintendo is DOOMED!""***, Nintendo defies demise.  
Their ability to take on all comers from the position they're in makes you wanna cheer for them. You wanna see 'em win.

On the precipice of Spring to Summer, Nintendo unleashed one of their best ""odd"" ideas yet. A new colorful take on the well-worn Shooter genre (exemplified by the endless Call of Duty series) called **Splatoon**. True to Nintendo style, this shooter is not filled with hyper-realism in the graphics with AAA big-money budgets & gritty American grunts looking all tough & hardcore. Splatoon has kawaii-cute teenaged maybe preteen squid-children shooting vividly colorful ""ink guns"" with a streetwise hip-hop graffiti aesthetic & an environmentalist overtone in the story backdrop. Absolutely unique idea.  
Nintendo is company filled with ARTISTS & ARTISTS challenge society & its accepted norms & customs.  
When Call of Duty demands that shooters be grimdark & morose, Splatoon subverts [EVERY BIT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L54s2m1dPs) of that convention by not only making things vibrantly colored & energetic but also by making the lead cover character FEMALE!  
A squid girl with pigtails is the mascot of the series! Take THAT, Call of Duty! **GO NINTENDO GO!!!**

Game was an instant hit right out of the gate. Nintendo was back on the rise on all cylinders now.  
June 2015 hosted the annual Electronic Entertainment Expo or E3 & Nintendo was just riding this new wave of power.  
They restarted the **Nintendo World Championships** from decades before on the heels of the breakthrough Super Smash Bros. Invitational game tournament from E3 2014. And at this event they release the phenomenal **Super Mario Maker**.  
For the first time ever, players can build their very own [Super Mario Bros. stages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwO09vJAPDs) using the range of templates & game mechanics from the original Super Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros. 3, Super Mario World, & New Super Mario Bros. U.  
It just doesn't GET any better than this! Satoru Iwata, Shigeru Miyamoto, & the rest of the Nintendo head honchos did the right thing by taking the pay cut & protecting their workers when times were rough. Now they are reaping the benefits.  
The trifecta of [President Iwata, Legendary Shigeru Miyamoto, & American President Reggie Fils-Aime AKA The Regginator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C73f618-3pk) will always win the day! The [Gaming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g834TBzerg8) [Revolution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt8CBYAnMYc) continues!........ Then suddenly in July of 2015, [**Satoru Iwata**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMrj8gdUfCU) died.

**And suddenly my escapist bubble of Virtuality burst leaving me dead in the heart of Reality.**  
Can't hide behind **The Console Wars** anymore. Nintendo will be crippled with [Iwata](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjNGZRzQXUA) gone. This might kill the Wii U & the fight against PlayStation 4 & XBox One. Iwata was one of the boys who literally worked his way from the ground up & was trusted with the company. They couldn't FIND a [better leader](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YG9INjO91Y) after Yamauchi. NOBODY can replace his presence on the [Nintendo Directs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiNIMXBxWxY) & his [developer stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Iwata_Asks_interviews) from [Iwata Asks](https://iwataasks.nintendo.com/). This was a man who cared & those who worked with him cared about him in turn. HE is what you wish people in business would be. He looks after his staff & always does the best work.  
Suddenly my heart for gameworld wasn't quite what it once was, try as I might to resist that truth.  
Bit by bit it was time to tune back in to what's going on in Reality. Depressing Powerless Reality.

&#x200B;

It turns out that there was some kind Presidential election going on. Hm, imagine that. Why are they starting so early though? It's still the Summer. This stuff doesn't usually get rolling until the Fall, I thought. Who's on the scene here?  
HA! **TRUMP?!?** Hahahahaha! This fool is just doing a [publicity stunt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyKMbq80gjo). He's [not serious](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIOWE2z6ri8) about running for President. Hahaha! Everybody knows this shit is about to be between **Hillary Clinton** & **Jeb Bush**, as much as that sucks. Give it up!  
Ah, oh my God. Hillary actually said that she's [""just chillin' in Cedar Rapids""](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/vvbwmj/hillary-clinton-accidentally-became-a-vine-meme). Oh God no! Please don't tell me she got a [""Chillary Clinton""](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2015/07/20/hillary_clinton_takes_up_snapchat_tells_the_world_she_is_chilling.html) drink coozy. Uhhhhhhh. How am I gonna be able to tolerate voting for this lame lady?  
Think of the Democratic Coalition, John. Think of the Coalition. Gotta beat the Southern Strategy. Tamp it down.  
Damn, there're a LOT of Republicans in this field this go 'round. Even more than last time. What is it? 17 of these guys?!  
The Democrats are running a light field this round. Just 5 of 'em? Hillary, Lincoln Chaffee, Jim Webb, Martin O'Malley, and......**Bernie Sanders???**  
Hm yeah, I heard of Bernie before. He's that random Independent. Good dude but MAN is he old! 73 almost 74??? God.  
He might have snuck into as high a seat as the U.S. Senate but only Insiders can be President. Too bad. He's actually cool.

**Wait what? Black activists bumrushed the stage at a Bernie rally & Bernie stepped back to let 'em have the mic???**  
Wow. Respect. I like that, Bernie. I like that very much. I really like that. Thank you for letting them speak their piece.  
We're simply not being HEARD. There's just too TOO many cold blooded murders by the police & non-badged racists.  
Can't take this anymore! This year we had Natasha McKenna, Anthony Hill, Walter Scott, Freddie Gray, the 9 people killed in that Charleston church, Sandra Bland!!! NO MORRRRRE!!!! **WHAT ARE YOU DOING OBAMA?!?!? STOOOP THIIIIIS!!!!!**  
**#BlackLivesMatter!!! #SayHerName!!!** **THANK YOU BERNIE!!** THANK YOU!! THANK YOU for letting them [have the mic](https://compote.slate.com/images/8bf20eb0-f07c-4c6f-8ec9-c96e7f7c1ed0.jpg).

Whereas in 2014 & early 2015, I compartmentalized my disillusionment by talking up stuff like 'the initial rollout of Obamacare shows that at least we have the START of a National Healthcare System'...  
...in mid-2015 more & more as I rejoined Reality & withdrew from Virtuality, it was getting harder & harder to tamp down my disappointment with the lost promise of 2008. What Obama was supposed to be & where we were supposed to go.  
I don't quite know what to make of Obama's [Rainbow White House](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVeWo_4gbAs) when the Supreme Court finally ruled in favor of Gay Marriage being Legal & Constitutional. **LOVE WINS**  but who does Obama really love politically? The victims of these  American Wars could use some of that love. So could the constantly murdered Blacks & other ethnicities targeted by racists. So could the Natives with these polluting pipelines. So could the endless victims of these mass shootings.  
The Obama Era was soon coming to a close & the only taste in my mouth was bittersweet. More bitter than sweet.

&#x200B;

Now that Fall has begun I slowly begin to truly listen to what's going on in the Presidential race.  
And things are starting to look **different**. More different than any election I had ever seen before in my life.  
This ain't the usual routine. This ain't George H.W. Bush's ""Read my lips. No new taxes"".  
This ain't Bill Clinton's ""I feel your pain"". This ain't Ross Perot's ""Giant sucking sound"". This ain't Bob Dole's ""Bob Dole"".  
This ain't Al Gore's ""Lockbox, Lockbox"". This ain't George W. Bush's ""Compassionate Conservatism"".  
This ain't Howard Dean's ""YEEAARRRRGGHH!!"" This ain't John Kerry's ""I voted for the $87 billion before I voted against it"".  
This ain't even Hillary Clinton's ""Shame on you, Barack Obama!"" or Barack Obama's ""Yes We Can"".  
It certainly ain't John McCain's ""Bomb Bomb Iran"" or Mitt Romney's ""Binders Full of Women"". This was...**NEW**.  
**Look At Donald Trump On This Stage!** He's MAULING the competition out here! This pompous motherfucker might  be the one to beat in the Republican field. He keeps saying WAY out-of-pocket things to anybody & everybody & it's working!  
**What did Bernie Sanders just do?** [He said he's sick & tired of hearing about Hillary's damn emails?!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOOfwN0iYxM) WHOA!! Interesting.  
That cuts Hillary a BIG break & allows him to focus on his policies. Who is this guy really? I gotta see more about him.

And see more about him I did. YouTube videos & Wikipedia biography checks were just the beginning.  
I discovered one of **THE MOST CONSISTENT & RIGHTEOUS PEOPLE YOU WILL EVER KNOW**. It's **ALL** in the [Video Record](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYxZfksAyco).  
**DECADE UPON DECADE UPON DECADE UPON DECADE** [getting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXo5fe7dYWk) [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vabeos-F8Kk) [right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_om-x323Em0) & [DOING](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAFlQ6fU4GM) [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca-GncBz60M) [right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJaW32ZTyKE) [thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSi0cz_Xvvw) **WAY** before it's [popular](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCyvyyo6dtQ).

**HE HAS BEEN HERE THE ENTIRE TIME & I NEVER REALLY TOOK AN IN-DEPTH LOOK AT HIM BEFORE! WHAT?!?!?**  
I knew on the most surface level that he was a pretty good dude but I didn't know just **HOW** [good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkvA96TQz0g) [he](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUom_28cY_I) [really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwDZMTGzG38) [was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sIpJiJ1heo).  
I felt guilty for not realizing [the Greatness of Bernie Sanders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww0oYgNQFoc) sooner. I wanted to [KICK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrqBuT6BhXQ) myself for [being](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwwwn9zHT-8) [so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFXgdq9FaxM) [ignorant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOh1IwK4cKM)!  
**JOHN!** What the hell is **WRONG** with you?! As much as you're politically informed, you miss **THIS?!? GET IT TOGETHER!**

&#x200B;

Bernie: ***The Top 1% has more wealth than the Bottom 99%. The Million-ehs & The Billion-ehs. The Billion-eh Class.***  
Bernie: ***Healthcare is a RIGHT not a Privilege. We need a Medicare For All Single-Pay-eh Healthcare System.***  
Bernie: ***Free Public College Tuition Free. We need moah Jobs & Education than Jails & Incarceration. It's Grotesque!***  
Bernie: ***We need to raise the Minimum Wage to a Living Wage. $15 bucks an howah! No more Starvation Wages.***  
Bernie: ***YUUUGE!! Yes yes, YUUUGE, I know. Goldman SACHS! WALL Street! Tell them they Can't Have It ALL!***  
Bernie: ***We need a Political Revolution in this country! When we come togethah, there is no goal we can't accomplish.***  
Me: **YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWWW!!! WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!! WHOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAA!!!**

&#x200B;

By the end of 2015, I have TOTALLY plugged in to this **Political Revolution** that Bernie Sanders spoke about.  
The plug towards Videogame World was pulled out of the socket. The adventures of Nintendo's 3DS & Wii U could wait.  
Time to delve into this new Reality not that old Virtuality. **The Console Wars would take a backseat to The Class Wars.**  
**The 1% vs. The 99%.** I saw the Gaming Revolution take place now I wanted to see the REAL one—the Political Revolution.  
Now that I'm fully tuned into Bernie's Revolutionary Movement I learn of a woman named **Nina Turner from Ohio**.  
She had JUST broken ranks with The Old Guard to back Bernie & is now on TV & the campaign trail [Feeling The Bern](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy3POGnetfE).  
**THAT GIRL IS BAAAD!!! GO NINA GO!!! SHE TELLS IT LIKE IT IS!!! 100% REAL!!! MY GOD!!! AMAZING WOMAN!!! WOW!!!**  
Bernie already lit a raging fire in me but Nina made EXTRA sure that I would **FEEL. THE. BERN!!!** Makes your **SOUL** shake!  
What is going on with me? Is Bernie making me believe again? Is this real? For real this time? This is not a dream, right?  
I don't HAVE to get behind Hillary Rodham Clinton to stop Jeb Bush? I can actually get behind someone good? Really?  
The more I Felt The Bern, the less I clung to that Cynical Resignment from my Disillusionment with Obama's lost promise.

And then it hit me: **If Barack Obama Was Not THE ONE, Then He WOULD LEAD To THE ONE.**

**Is Bernie Sanders THE ONE?** Look at it. **A Multi-Cultural People's Movement, antidote to the poison of Reaganomics.**  
I'm a sucker for those. And Bernie Sanders reminds me so much of Ralph Nader in presentation & message.  
He's not focus-group tested with those politician hand gestures. He waves his arms around like he's bringing in planes!  
He has this [wild flying white frazzly hair](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Dzzhj62U8AA5K4R.jpg) with his bald spot showing. His clothes are obviously off the rack not tailored.  
Just one real ass dude who ain't got TIME to look pretty. He's trying to get The People's Business done.  
And it just doesn't GET any more ""Left"" than Bernie Sanders. I seem to be BORN on ""The Left"". How can I resist?  
The man just flat out said [**""I am a Democratic Socialist""**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7jlAZSGXf4) with no flinch or hesitation. Balls. Guts. How can I resist?  
**HE'S THE ONE. HE'S THE ONE.** Yet I had NO idea how much Bernie's Revolution would change me as I moved into 2016.

◄Continued in Part 9►  
John Lucas","Bring it!!! ✌️

You are entirely correct in that I skipped everything relating to Games.

Then, I followed every word and what struck me the most was the Idea that Obama wasn't the One but he would lead us to the One.

Which I interpreted then and Now as **leading us away form Hill.**

O's ""support"" for Hill was mainly campaigning for her in areas where she either had already Lost or they could push her over the Losing line.

   Just as the DNC clan all did for Alison Lundegran Grimes when she was beating Mitch McConnell and the dnc corporacrats could not have that at all.  They joined en masse to sink ALG's ship and sink it did.

No Merrick Garland and so on...........

Will O continue to sink the clinton affiliated ship????  IDK

@NYCVG Yeah, that gaming stuff is dense. But you are catching onto the allegory I'm alluding to with those references. You see how my value system is at work even in a totally unrelated field. I'm of ""The Left"" by birth.  
I was frustrated with the lack of Change in Real Life that I looked for Change in Game Life.  
That's probably what fuels a lot of our pastimes & hobbies. We put effort on the worlds we can control.  
I cheered on the Gaming Revolution just as fervently as I cheered on Bernie's Revolution.  
You can see how much my Nintendo Console War talk rhymes with the talk of Bernie's War on Establishment.  
In each realm, I was looking for a transformation of the world we were in & wanted people to come together.  
I loved both the 'WE' in Wii & the 'US' in ""Not Me, Us."" It's pretty eerie when you type it all up on screen.

And yes, I will talk about Obama's link to Bernie too. Most people don't realize it exists. It's faint but it's there.  
Partially I will speak about that link in this Political History & partially in my telling of **Bernie's Master Plan**.  
And yes, I missed the Halloween deadline. Work interfered with my write-up. Put me behind schedule.  
I'll just move it to **November 3rd**, the day that's exactly one year from the 2020 Election. WOW! Almost here!

For now though, enjoy the Happy Place you have been waiting for so long.  
u/NYCVG, [**Part 9**](https://www.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/dqebml/my_political_history_aka_my_journey_to_the/) is finally here! u/Pixiechicken, u/FunLovingMonster you jump in too! It's a good one!

I don't know what I would do without a guy like you in my life! You are just soooooo nice to me, like the older brother  I never had combined with the girl friend i can tell anything too! I honestly have no idea how you are still single!

The amount of favours you have done for me OMG! Buying me clothes, giving me lifts, paying when we eat out, letting me stay with you rent free, that time you let me and Marcus and James use your bed because Chloe and Jake were using mine.

Like sure there have been one or two awkward moments in our friendship. Like that time early on when you told me you were in love with me. It was so adorable I couldn't even! But when I explained that I only have sex with black guys you didn't take it well, but after an hour of explaining intersectional feminism and BlackLivesMatter to you, I think you understood and have been a much better ally since then. 

So anyway, the reason I am gushing over how you are the most amazing best friend in the world is... you know how you told me your parents were away this weekend? I was thinking maybe we could have a party? It will be so much fun!! All the guys will be there! (And all my girlfriends! You never know this might be your lucky night with Emily or Stef! You just need to get over the anxiety of your first kiss and build up the confidence to talk to them!)

Bad bait

At least the Hong Kong thing is based on reality.  There's a good reason the BLM movement died.

[deleted]

There's Harvard studies that probe while police brutality is a thing, it has nothing to do with racial profiling—just the demographics and corruptions in big cities in general.

Most BLM protestors jump to quickly at police incidents and exaggerate the actual rate at which unarmed black people are shot and killed. 

They even glorify and victimize actual criminals who attempt to kill police officers and are shot in response. 

For example there was a recent shooting where a knife wielding man, who yes was black, was shot and killed after rushing a police officer who got out his cruiser. All of twitter immediately jumped at the police officer saying he murdered an innocent man. Millions of views on a clipped video made to look like the police officer just executed the dude. Nobody tries to find the whole story or watch the entire badge cam footage. Ridiculous.

From an outsider's point of view, there seemed to be quite a lot of sympathy and enthusiasm for the BLM movement.

But once some people decided to use violence, and accuse pretty much everyone not in their movement of being racist, people lost interest.

I really liked the BLM movement until they hosted a blacks-only party. It went downhill from there very quickly.

Tell it to hello kitty, Chairman Meow!

Blacks kill each other more than cops do.

Lol, if a person commits a crime and the police shoots him; then you must look at the person. Not the color. But black people commit 50% of all crimes in the U.S while they make up 14% of the population. So police brutality is necessary.

fuck you and fuck hong kong, free jerry sandusky

That’s because police brutality is largely isolated events that simply stay in the news cycle for months, making it seem like a problem when it isn’t.

Police brutality is not a problem.

Oh look, two other groups suffering from the same thing.

Must not be ""reality"" right?

Sexism does not equal racism. 

Are there specific strategies used by the NYPD and other police agencies to incarcerate only men? Nope. There are against minorities though. 

Is there evidence the private prison industry works with the police to increase incarceration of minorities? Yep. 

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4111266/

Are there voter restriction laws directly from the Jim Crow era of America that coincide with restricting the votes of people who's served their time? Yep. 

https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1532673X18810012

Have you ever worked in a minority community and studied the disparities they face? Probably not. So why are you so adamant about your baseless opinion?

And yet, there are studies that show while minorities are less likely to harbor marijuana, they're more likely to go to jail for it. 

I don't see any little white kids locked in cages by ICE either.

And whites kill each other even more than both. 

Proximity=crime rates. It does not dismiss the fact that police brutality is an issue. All it says is that America is still largely segregated.

Man, you almost had a coherent argument until that last little bit.

If you like 😏😗😉.

So unless it’s happening on every corner it’s not a problem?

[deleted]

Are white people crossing the border in mass numbers with their children?

Well, we can't allow people to just harbor marijuana.

>I don't see any little white kids locked in cages by ICE either.

Well seeing as most of the kids come from Central America I think that will be the case for a while.

>Proximity=crime rates

Yes. Proximity to a black neighborhood makes people more likely to be a victim of a violent crime regardless of their race.

Segregation in America is no longer a government enforced thing, it’s done societally, you can see it even in groups of students nowadays, people of the same ethnic group will stay together, it’s natural. I’m of course not advocating for segregation, simply stating that it’s not really something that we as a society can REALLY fix. The concept of ethnicity in and of itself makes complete de-segregation impossible.

Now, about that, your argument that “whites kill each other more than both” is fallacious, it’s like the arguments for gun deaths in the United States. People look at the overall number, but the overall number doesn’t give you a good idea of how it actually is, we have to look at things on a Per Capita basis, per 1 out of every X people. When you look at it Per Capita, African Americans and Latinos are responsible for a large majority of violent crime in the United States, and I can say with some degree of confidence that a lot of that has to do with the fact that they are more inclined to that. 

Now, before I get crucified, this has a lot to do with epigenetics, trauma down the generational line has been shown to,  theoretically, have an effect on the expression of genes, and aspects of how we function. Epigenetics are held responsible for the extremely high infant mortality rates (comparable to sub-Saharan Africa) in New York amongst African Americans. 

It’s an undeniable fact that Latinos and African Americans are responsible for lost violent crime in the U.S., and arguments otherwise are simply fallacious and are bending the truth to deceive people, whether the deceiver knows it or not. What we don’t know for sure, is how much of that can be blamed on what occurred to those in their families, regardless of where they came from, several generations back.

Anyways, a lot of that was probably just a rant to you, so- moving on to how Police Brutality is a problem. I won’t disagree with you that the police may need some reforms, but are they racist? Current studies show that Black people have a ~1/1000 chance of being sh and killed by police in their lifetime (Though I doubt the credibility of the source), and that White Americans have a ~39/100000 chance, or, a ~1/2500 chance, roughly, of being shot and killed. This shows that Black Men are 2.5 times more likely to be shot and killed by a police officer. Another study (It’s used in an Atlantic Article so there is likely a good degree of bias in support of African Americans) says that ~25% of those killed by Police are African American, despite making up only ~14% of the population. Going back to past arguments, if Black People commit ~50% of Violent Crime in the United States, despite making up ~14% of the population, is this really a problem of African Americans being targeted? No, because if they were, a lot more of them would be dying. Instead, this is simply a problem of the police using excessive force too often to begin with.

Okay well, rant over ig. If any of it doesn’t make sense go ahead and ask and I’ll try to explain it better.

Well he does have KKK in his username....

Exactly.

Its literally a wikipedia page. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Police_Department_corruption_and_misconduct

What, you think having a black person in power will end everything? That doesn't even make sense. **Think about your argument**. Does having a women as president end sexism? No? Did Pete Buttigieg end homophobia? No as well? Well then. 

**Stop using false equivalencies, stop acting like you're an expert, and listen to minorities. THEN make your opinions based off that. Its not an attack on you that other people suffer differently from you.**

HAHAHAHA

Cute. You're wrong. 

https://psmag.com/news/most-undocumented-immigrants-are-not-mexican

Violent crimes? Yep. But police brutality and  racial profiling? No. They are not synonymous. 

And the stunts the police pulled against protestors in Ferguson and against the Native American land protests. Police used the same tactics of oppression and racism. 

https://www.cnn.com/2017/11/10/us/native-lives-matter/index.html

Oh, you guys thought you could just disparage black people and all of the sudden police brutality doesn't exist? 😂  It occurs with the mentally ill as well. Specifically with people on the autism spectrum.

Super cute. That is for undocumented immigrants, not the ones locked in cages. 

https://www.freedomforimmigrants.org/detention-statistics

Good try though.

I never said anything about police brutality. Sure it exists.

Black people also commit a disproportionate amount of  crime though so I'm sure the cops really can't help but profile. That doesn't justify police brutality but you act as if it's just the mean white cops picking on blacks for no reason.

Stop and frisk policies 

https://www.rand.org/pubs/technical_reports/TR534.html

You can read right?

Yes I can. That wasn’t the link you originally sent. Word of advice, instead of being hostile toward people for no reason, being polite tends to get you further in life.


Also for your own source:


“We found that black pedestrians were stopped at a rate that is 20 to 30 percent lower than their representation in crime-suspect descriptions. Hispanic pedestrians were stopped disproportionately more, by 5 to 10 percent, than their representation among crime-suspect descriptions would predict.”

It wasn't. Never said it was. 

Nah. Tired of being civil. 

We can disagree and still love each other unless your disagreement is rooted in my oppression and denial of my humanity and right to exist.” -James Baldwin

Well coming from a gay Jew good luck. Also probably wise to find studies that support your argument next time.

End of tweet list.","I was involved in a shooting years ago. Fellow police officers have no business questioning the police officer who shot. That is left up to detectives and the state’s attorney’s office. It is be very normal for fellow cop’s to calm the officer down. That is not evidence of a coverup. 

In my personal opinion. Both fucked up. You should never fight or take a taser for a cop. The cop totally fucked up. But I’ve been there. Police are trained and legally allowed to shoot a suspect who takes a weapon away from them. Tunnel vision fucked him up.

What's your excuse for the other cops laughing and making light of the situation? Slager is one thing, he might have laughed due to the fact his emotions were overwhelming him, but the other cops have no such excuse. The cop didn't ""fuck up"", he was POS and so were his fellow cops.

Slager is serving 20 years in prison, and the only reason he is getting that is because of the freedom to film anyone.

Oh weird, the boot licker is here to defend the other worthless pieces of shit.  Please don't track me down and shoot my dog..... Thanks.

Any proof they were laughing at the victim? I saw the footage. He took the taser and dropped it when he ran away.

Edit: Are you actually saying people don’t trust the police because I said you shouldn’t fight or disarm them?

Yeah cops are always shooting unarmed black men and dogs. Ever experience any of those urban legends or is Reddit and your grandma’s basement the extent of your reality?

They made light of the situation and tried to cover it up. There is no excuse for that. It wasn't  just a ""fuck up"", it was criminal. An unarmed guy was shot in the back repeatedly and then he fabricated the report. 

&#x200B;

> Any proof they were laughing at the victim? 

&#x200B;

I never said victim, I said situation. Have you read the article?

&#x200B;

>Instead of trying to learn more about the facts, the officers are  immediately telling Slager to relax as they share laughs over his  adrenalin pumping experience.

&#x200B;

I do not have access to the police recording. I guess the article could be lying. 

&#x200B;

As the grabbing of the taser, eyewitness says it didn't happen that way. And considering how the police officer initial report was total bullshit thanks to the video and witness, I do not trust that cop at all. The cop ""feared for his life"" because a guy was running away from him. 

&#x200B;

And no I agree with you, you shouldn't fight a cop but there is no defence for trigger happy cops.

Because fuck racists, that's why.

You really need that debunked?!

Debating idiots legitimizes their beliefs when their ideas are beneath debate. Racists also argue in bad faith, as in the don’t intend to have their ideas changed by logic, so it’s basically a parfait of don’t debate reasons wrapped in skewed statistics. This is why people punch Nazis instead of trying to coddle them in to reason.

Sex only costs a lie...sometimes.  

I thought I had it figured out.  The system has effected the guys like “x”, which put women in a position like “y” and the best way to solve the decreased value placed on intimacy, was for women to hold their standards.  

I’ve held-in my chatting, streaming desires until a friend was over and he went on.  I was off-screen and provided my “your are the stuff” talk as a counter to what my friends position.  The feedback was pretty good...but then...I went on by myself the next day...planning to build followers and move to another format.  Without going into details...I went thru the stages of grief - 1. Denial and isolation; 2. Anger; 3. Bargaining; 4. Depression; 5. Acceptance.   

We need to talk about this.  It is much, much worse than I thought.  Media pushes it, a current candidate mentioned certain sites that I won’t advertise like they did, radio has been getting rich off the degradation of the black women’s regard and black men’s lives. 
 
This is not about dating sites.  This is about the multi-dimensional assault that no voices are being heard opposing at all.  It’s just mom or dad often against every other voice in the world. 

We need to talk.  What do you think?

85,,"Civil Rights Ended segregation, Suffrage lead to women getting the right to Vote, what are #BlackLivesMatter & #MeToo asking for that the government(s) can solve ?",2,csnnkr,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/csnnkr/civil_rights_ended_segregation_suffrage_lead_to/,3,2019-08-20 13:25:05,[deleted],"Black Lives Matter are more in favour of police and prison abolition, and dealing with wider issues of racism (particularly anti-black racism). The government could undo a lot of the damage leftover from slavery, segragation, and war on drugs - demilitarise police at least, get rid of for profit prisons, also address racism such as by giving reparations and addressing racist policies.

MeToo focuses on sexual harassment and sexual abuse overall, including rape - it initially focused on workplace harassment, particularly towards minority women. Better protection for victims, overall work towards gender equality, looking at causes of gendered sexual violence, consent education, harsher punishment for those who commit rape, etc. from government would help.

The Civil Rights Movement and suffrage movement ended *government-mandated* discrimination, where it was *illegal* to treat people equally. Black Lives Matters and #MeToo are about ending systemic discrimination that still exists even though the law no longer requires it. BLM is more specific to the government itself since it's primarily about how police treat black citizens. Governments can solve this by identifying discriminatory acts and actually punishing the criminal-cops who perpetrate them instead of closing ranks. Fire, arrest, prosecute, imprison. Demilitarization would also go a long way. No civilian police officer should ever be issued camo-print uniforms. If you give people military equipment and dress them up like soldiers, you should expect them to start acting like soldiers and treating *someone* like enemy soldiers.

The #MeToo movement is broader than just government, though governments can still do a lot to help. There is a ludicrous backlog of untested rape kits. It's well established that many victims of rape or sexual assault don't come forward but even when they do, their local government may not even do anything about it. ""It's not in the budget."" What does that say to women? We value you, but not enough to even test your rape kit so we can hopefully find and/or convict the person who raped you? I don't want to go on too long but there are other ways that governments can be better allies that are entirely within their own control, such as the way rape is handled in the military, and how sexual predators in public office are treated by other people in public office. It would have been super easy for Republican senators reject Brett Kavanaugh and go for any one of dozens of other qualified jurists who would have quickly gone through the nomination process, but instead they *choose* to defend a predator and install him on the Supreme Court. It's not even like this was an impeachment hearing; literally the least they could do would be to not give him a *promotion* but they did it anyway.

> shouldn't the police have the right weapons to protect their citizens.

Yes, but the equipment they actually have is often grossly excessive for any sort of legitimate police activity, and equipment that might be appropriately used on rare occasion gets trotted out in inappropriate circumstances for the simple reason that they have it and nobody told them they couldn't use it. One police department might see a group of protesters marching and decide the best way to handle it is with armored personnel carriers with sharpshooters on it aiming at the crowd. Other departments might see the same crowd and use far more appropriate tactics, such as police standing on the ground using bicycles as physical barriers to direct the crowd.

> Americans have a weird blind trust with immigrants.

Of the three groups, citizens commit the most crimes person, legal immigrants the second most, and undocumented immigrants commit the fewest crimes per person. I'm really unsure of where you're trying to go with this since it's really tangential to your original question.

> I don't see any laws that say that rape victims shouldn't be taken seriously.

The law could *require* that rape kits be tested quickly, but in most places it doesn't. That's entirely within the control of the people making the laws.

This is an excerpt from my series on Portland's Red History. Definitely read my two prior pieces:

- [""Portland's Red History: The Red Squad, Bloody Shirt, Longshoremen. Early Portland to the 1930's""](https://old.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/asuu1a/portlands_red_history_the_red_squad_bloody_shirt/) 

- [""Portland's Red History: WW2, the Counter Intelligence Program known as COINTELPRO, and Portland's Red Squad 2.0.""](https://old.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/avxcdd/portlands_red_history_ww2_the_counter/)

I intended to publish another section on the 1990's and the shift to ""eco-terrorism"" then nuTerrorism of post-9/11 and how Red Squad continues to operate. I'm publishing this because it seems pretty timely given the FBI's [recent statements about ""no known threats""](https://old.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/cmhkmf/there_are_no_known_threats_in_our_area_portland/) in an effort to illustrate that the FBI and DHS don't know dick about terrorist threats.

Honestly, I'm surprised that FBI didn't just blurt out, ""Black People and vegans"" are the biggest terrorist threat, because based upon their DHS colleagues reporting, that's the biggest issues.
 
I could write a whole book documenting the incompetent morons who work at DHS Fusion Centers. They're provide counter-terrorism intelligence worse than the TSA provides airport security. 

As an example, DHS claims they have 70 operating Fusion Centers across the country, yet in [a 2012 bipartisan report](https://www.csoonline.com/article/2223243/microsoft-subnet/fusion-centers-don-t-find-terrorists--filled-with--crap--that-violates-privacy.html) found DHS couldn't even produce a list of the addresses of all 70 centers they think they're funding. A [report](https://olis.leg.state.or.us/liz/2017R1/Downloads/CommitteeMeetingDocument/126814) from Oregon has a map of Fusion Centers around the US, the map has about 30. DHS can't account for Fusion Center spending, believing they spent in the range of $289 million to $1.4 billion, meaning DHS couldn't account for over $1 billion of their budget. That report also found that **not a single report from a DHS Fusion Center was useful in counter-terrorism.** 

When you read deeply into the [actual report](https://info.publicintelligence.net/HSGAC-FusionCenters.pdf), you'll find that Fusion Centers across the country are stacked with right wings nutjobs who get their counter-terrorism tips from Fox News and Breitbart - and that in some cases these idiots actually submitted TV news reports as terrorist ""intelligence"". Racism and Islamophobia are huge drivers of Fusion Center activity. This report showed that the entire organization (from investigators at the bottom to leadership at the top) was a shit show that **Fusion Centers produced nothing of actual use since 2003**.

All of this same shenanigans and incompetency is echoed at the Oregon Fusion Center, nicknamed TITAN. 

In all of TITAN's history [they've only pointed to a single successful investigation](https://olis.leg.state.or.us/liz/2017R1/Downloads/CommitteeMeetingDocument/126814) that I've been able to identify: [John Michael Townsend](https://www.oregonlive.com/north-of-26/2016/07/ex-park_security_officer_who_s.html). 

Mr. Townsend was an arsonist and Parks employee who was *first on the scene* at more than one arson. According to TITAN's document, they found a discrepancy in where he claimed he was at versus where his cell phone was. Kudos to them for producing evidence that the guy who showed up *first* to more than one arson was the guy responsible for the arsons - real detective work to piece all that together.

This Fusion Center is primarily staffed by [Oregon DOJ's Criminal Justice Division](https://www.doj.state.or.us/oregon-department-of-justice/divisions/criminal-justice/), which consists of one attorney, two Special Agents, one Special Agent In Charge, an Assistant Special Agent In Charge, five Research Analysts, and an IS Specialist. They claim TITAN started in 2007, but this is only half true. The ODOJ's Criminal Intelligence Center has been around since 1977 and simply rebranded TITAN in 2007.

## Here's why this group is such an embarrassment: 

**TITAN Research Analysts came to believe that the executive head of Oregon Department of Justice’s Director of the Civil Rights Unit, Erious Johnson, was a threat to police** because he used #BlackLivesMatter and used a photo of the rap group Public Enemy on his Twitter profile in 2015. Shitty reporting by *Willamette Week* and *The Oregonian* whitewashed the fiasco and claimed that only Special Agent James R. Williams was responsible. Yet [source documents of the investigation](https://aclu-or.org/sites/default/files/DOJ_Investigation_Final_Redacted_Report.pdf) make it clear that it wasn't just one investigator, but all 5 Research Analysts at the Fusion Center where involved in this investigation and ""no one expressed concern."" Moreover **it took 20 days** for the Fusion Center to realize they fucked up when accusing the leader at the Oregon DOJ's Civil Rights Unit of threatening the police.

The official story was:

> Around September 10, 2015, the Fusion Center issued a report in its weekly bulletin advising that members of #blacklivesmatter and #fy911 social media users were calling for the murder of police officers on a site called Blog Talk Radio."" 

I presume they're referring to the obscure [BLMshow](http://www.blogtalkradio.com/blmshow) which never gained any popularity. I can't find the specific episode in which they think this was reported. But as we will see this officially story falls apart. Consider though, have you heard of ""blog talk radio""? Has anyone? How many hours of tax payer time was spent listening to this obscure podcast listening for threats? Let that sink in: this was the best use of their time.

What we know about this incident:

- The Special Agent James R. Williams said the investigation into #blacklivesmatter was [spurred](https://www.wweek.com/news/courts/2017/03/28/state-investigator-who-surveilled-civil-rights-director-sues-oregon-attorney-general-saying-he-was-following-orders/) by the Bonneville Power Administration who was concerned that the 2015 film *Straight Outta Compton* about the history of the rap group NWA. The BPA believed this film would result in violence by Black Lives Matter protesters. **At least that's what he said in the papers.** Again: **Someone at BPA thought a documentary film about a rap group was going to result in violence** that's what the Fusion Center investigated. During the DOJ investigation he claimed otherwise, that his investigation was started because of flyers from other agencies - the report specifically noted another separate incident which ""undermined [Special Agent James Williams] credibility.""

- Someone at Bonneville Power Administration is dumb enough to believe that a movie posed a threat, and for that dumbass to have caught the attention of investigators at TITAN means they must be a member of InfraGuard. A way of infusing private business into the Red Squad activities. I'm pretty sure I actually met this guy, as he's about 6'2 overweight bald guy and we sat together briefly at a city meeting on the JTTF. He completely spilled the beans as soon as I said hello to him about his role at BPA and being a liaison to InfraGuard. He's the type of guy who just missed the Vietnam war and it's always bothered him so he's got a big hard-on for American Flag Law but would authoritatively yet incorrectly declare the wrong statute in US Code. His biggest concern was the vulnerabilities of the power grid as if Antifa/Blackbloc or eco-terrorists or the Animal Liberation Front commonly use a tactic of blowing up transformers - which, umm... *spoilers* has never happened. It's men like this, an out of touch federal bureaucrat, who feed the FBI/DHS tips through InfraGuard.

- Special Agent Williams believed ""any kind of social disobedience"" represents a threat to law enforcement and the public. Put bluntly: any protest is a threat to the cops, therefore all protests should be watched. He ""does not believe any search terms are off limits"" and was unaware and not trained on ORS 181.575 even though he had a 20-year law enforcement career in Oregon including as a detective. 

([ORS 181.575](https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/2013/181.575) was a big focus on [my second article](https://old.reddit.com/r/fidelitypdx/comments/avwgic/portlands_red_history_ww2_the_counter/) it was a law enacted by Legislature in 1981 *explicitly* to prevent Red Squad type activities by limiting what data they can collect - it's routinely violated by police). 

- This entire investigation was also done outside of the TITAN center's written policies, which specifically declared that investigators were not to *seek* information unless it related to a criminal case. For an investigation to be related to a criminal case, TITAN investigators need a criminal case number. Special Agent Williams never sought a case number.

- As another embarrassing anecdote, Special Agent Williams also mistook artwork from the Portland music venue *The Know* as a threat against police. Grasping at straws, he claimed to believe this artwork was the cover of an NWA album - which probably in his mind solidified a lot of this investigation.

The source documents also included a quote from Darin Tweedt, the DOJ lawyer who oversees operations at TITAN, which makes it clear that in the past TITAN has continued violating Oregon Law:

> One of Darin Tweedt’s concerns regarding the Fusion Center was that it was operating in an outdated manner with few written policies that were poorly communicated and were insufficient to address relevant issues.  There was also a concern as to what information the Fusion Center should be disseminating as bulletins—for example, **in the past, the Fusion Center was prepared to report on groups that were assembling in protest even when there was no report of criminal nexus or public safety concern.**

## Day-to-Day Operations at the Oregon Titan Fusion Center

Here's what Oregon TITAN Fusion Center employees actually do on the day-to-day in 2015 based upon the DOJ audit. Keep in mind these people are **the lead** on finding terrorism threats in Oregon.

- One Research Analyst, employed since the year 2000, specializes in Social Media and actively monitors web traffic for threats made online. (Hello from Reddit)

- Another Research Analyst, employed since 2006, was assigned to ""monitor drug trafficking"". She also reviewed the report written by Special Agent Williams before it was forwarded to management. She also believed DOJ's Civil Rights Division's leader ""should not be tweeting such messages"" because #BlackLivesMatter is taboo.

- Another Research Analyst, employed since 1999, seems to primarily target ecoterrorism. When given access to the social media analysis tool, their first inquiry was ""Animal Liberation Front"" in the Seattle area to see if protesters were trying to target UW. One must wonder why an Oregon tax-paid Research Analyst does cross-state researching - and if other researchers outside of Oregon research Oregonians. This researcher also published an alert to other agencies on #BlackLivesMatter.

- Another Research Analyst, employed since 2002, handled terrorism matters like the 2015 Umpqua Community College shooting. (whoopsies!) This investigator also tested out ecoterrorism phrases on social media based upon protest activity in Seattle. 

- One Special Agent is assigned to Internet Crimes Against Children. He claims his investigations are always related to a criminal investigation of sex crimes. He does not recall ever being trained on ORS 181.575. When the Umpqua Community College shooting happened this Special Agent investigated the Black Lives Matter movement based upon internet rumors that the shooter was associated with the movement. This Special Agent believed the Fusion Center kept an ongoing investigation of #BlackLivesMatter and other groups that might use phrases that express hostility toward the police.

- Then there is a second Special Agent (this was Agent Williams) who described his scope of work as *conduct searches as requested by his supervisors or law enforcement agencies on specific matters such as threats at schools.  Other times, he would do searches without being requested if the search was based on cases/investigations he had going on or based on “what’s hot in the news.”*

- A Special Agent in Charge who is a police officer that reports to Chief Counsel. As a manager they assigned tasks to investigators and analysts - *assignments include monitoring sovereign citizens, [outlaw motorcycle gangs], individuals making threats on the Attorney General and actual criminal cases.* Importantly, *assignments did not include monitoring or gathering information on threats to police…* 

- DOJ Chief Counsel, the Lawyer, employed since 2007. This person oversees everything.

- A Senior Research Analyst, employed for at least 10 years, claimed their role is to support law enforcement with its cases, ""specifically drug cases."" However, this person also had strong opinions on #blacklivesmatter had a criminal nexus that should be investigated, and cited examples she believed of investigations in other parts of the country.

With just these employees we can see that there's massive confusion about TITAN's scope of investigations, lack of training, and ample personal bias injected into investigations. **TITAN doesn't know if it's part of their job or not to investigate threats against the police on their own.** This isn't a scenario where ""Diversity training"" is going to fix anything, this is a fundamental misunderstanding about every employee's role within a small team - not a single employee was on the same page about what their group does, or what laws and policies govern their activities. 

Here's another great example https://youtu.be/2qZJtTwUKpw while these videographers may be goons, just look at the reaction of this woman who tries to intimidated these guys. Seems like that woman is a hardcore authoritarian with a self-importance complex. As soon as this woman has a camera pointed at her face, she admits what the building is and that the Oregon TITAN Fusion Center. Which, by the way is location at 610 Hawthorne Ave., Suite 210 Salem, OR 97301.  *It's on Google FFS* - this video is the first result when you Google Oregon Titan. What did she think she was protecting by engaging some Sovereign Citizens and sheepishly walking away 60 seconds later? ***That's a leader in our counter-terrorism division.***

Or, my favorite example of incompetence: their official URL https://ortitan.org has lapsed, their public facing website and all of their reports are down - lots of government agencies link to this URL. How goddamn incompetent do you have to be? 

We have to shut TITAN down. It's corrupt. It's worthless. It's contributing the long horrid legacy of being an active part of the Red Squad.

If DOJ and the Government of Oregon thinks there's merit to continuing this type of Criminal Investigation Center then it should be possibly reopened with a more diverse workforce. Like people under the age of 35 who might understand that black liberals are not terrorists. There not only needs to be clear policies about what is rule of law in Oregon, but also rotating staff so that no one Analyst becomes embedded with too much power. As the military has shown, it's not necessary to be a 10+ year veteran of law enforcement to be a good intelligence analyst, we train 18 year olds to carry out this task.

Today in 2019 I'm sure the priority of the OTFC has shifted from ""Black Lives Matter"" to researching the ""Antifa"" and ""Patriot Prayer"" and the ""Proud Boys"" - how many months have they had to identify criminal activity? How many youtube videos need to be published by either side showing wrong doing? If ""Black Lives Matter"" and Seattle based vegans represented worthwhile efforts for the Fusion Center, you can be sure that anything you're posting online about Antifa and the Proud Boys is being monitored. I'm conflicted about if this is a good or bad thing that they're too incompetent to do anything about it.

##**Not Just Oregon's Problem**

[That 2012 bipartisan federal report](https://www.csoonline.com/article/2223243/microsoft-subnet/fusion-centers-don-t-find-terrorists--filled-with--crap--that-violates-privacy.html) on Fusion Centers across the country found that **all of them** are worthless. None are contributing meaningfully to counter-terrorism and none can even justify their own existence - worse, some have disrupted actual counter-terrorism actions. Every ""alert"" put out by a Fusion Center has been without merit and often wastes resources. But most importantly of all: in example after example the personal bias of intelligence analysis has been used as a justification for law enforcement actions.","They are [hiring](https://oregon.wd5.myworkdayjobs.com/en-US/SOR_External_Career_Site/job/Spinnaker-Point---DOJ/Criminal-Intelligence-Analyst_REQ-17744) get in there and make some changes from within the system. 

We really do need an actual analysis center that coordinates information to agencies statewide. I agree that it’s currently done quite poorly. Does it need to be at DOJ? Would OSP’s analysts be a better fit for this work? Possibly.

([ORS 181.575](https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/2013/181.575) was a big focus on [my second article](https://old.reddit.com/r/fidelitypdx/comments/avwgic/portlands_red_history_ww2_the_counter/) it was a law enacted by Legislature in 1981 *explicitly* to prevent Red Squad type activities by limiting what data they can collect - it's routinely violated by police). 

- This entire investigation was also done outside of the TITAN center's written policies, which specifically declared that investigators were not to *seek* information unless it related to a criminal case. For an investigation to be related to a criminal case, TITAN investigators need a criminal case number. Special Agent Williams never sought a case number.

- As another embarrassing anecdote, Special Agent Williams also mistook artwork from the Portland music venue *The Know* as a threat against police. Grasping at straws, he claimed to believe this artwork was the cover of an NWA album - which probably in his mind solidified a lot of this investigation.

The source documents also included a quote from Darin Tweedt, the DOJ lawyer who oversees operations at TITAN, which makes it clear that in the past TITAN has continued violating Oregon Law:

> One of Darin Tweedt’s concerns regarding the Fusion Center was that it was operating in an outdated manner with few written policies that were poorly communicated and were insufficient to address relevant issues.  There was also a concern as to what information the Fusion Center should be disseminating as bulletins—for example, **in the past, the Fusion Center was prepared to report on groups that were assembling in protest even when there was no report of criminal nexus or public safety concern.**

## Day-to-Day Operations at the Oregon Titan Fusion Center

Here's what Oregon TITAN Fusion Center employees actually do on the day-to-day in 2015 based upon the DOJ audit. Keep in mind these people are **the lead** on finding terrorism threats in Oregon.

- One Research Analyst, employed since the year 2000, specializes in Social Media and actively monitors web traffic for threats made online. (Hello from Reddit)

- Another Research Analyst, employed since 2006, was assigned to ""monitor drug trafficking"". She also reviewed the report written by Special Agent Williams before it was forwarded to management. She also believed DOJ's Civil Rights Division's leader ""should not be tweeting such messages"" because #BlackLivesMatter is taboo.

- Another Research Analyst, employed since 1999, seems to primarily target ecoterrorism. When given access to the social media analysis tool, their first inquiry was ""Animal Liberation Front"" in the Seattle area to see if protesters were trying to target UW. One must wonder why an Oregon tax-paid Research Analyst does cross-state researching - and if other researchers outside of Oregon research Oregonians. This researcher also published an alert to other agencies on #BlackLivesMatter.

- Another Research Analyst, employed since 2002, handled terrorism matters like the 2015 Umpqua Community College shooting. (whoopsies!) This investigator also tested out ecoterrorism phrases on social media based upon protest activity in Seattle. 

- One Special Agent is assigned to Internet Crimes Against Children. He claims his investigations are always related to a criminal investigation of sex crimes. He does not recall ever being trained on ORS 181.575. When the Umpqua Community College shooting happened this Special Agent investigated the Black Lives Matter movement based upon internet rumors that the shooter was associated with the movement. This Special Agent believed the Fusion Center kept an ongoing investigation of #BlackLivesMatter and other groups that might use phrases that express hostility toward the police.

- Then there is a second Special Agent (this was Agent Williams) who described his scope of work as *conduct searches as requested by his supervisors or law enforcement agencies on specific matters such as threats at schools.  Other times, he would do searches without being requested if the search was based on cases/investigations he had going on or based on “what’s hot in the news.”*

- A Special Agent in Charge who is a police officer that reports to Chief Counsel. As a manager they assigned tasks to investigators and analysts - *assignments include monitoring sovereign citizens, [outlaw motorcycle gangs], individuals making threats on the Attorney General and actual criminal cases.* Importantly, *assignments did not include monitoring or gathering information on threats to police…* 

- DOJ Chief Counsel, the Lawyer, employed since 2007. This person oversees everything.

- A Senior Research Analyst, employed for at least 10 years, claimed their role is to support law enforcement with its cases, ""specifically drug cases."" However, this person also had strong opinions on #blacklivesmatter had a criminal nexus that should be investigated, and cited examples she believed of investigations in other parts of the country.

With just these employees we can see that there's massive confusion about TITAN's scope of investigations, lack of training, and ample personal bias injected into investigations. **TITAN doesn't know if it's part of their job or not to investigate threats against the police on their own.** This isn't a scenario where ""Diversity training"" is going to fix anything, this is a fundamental misunderstanding about every employee's role within a small team - not a single employee was on the same page about what their group does, or what laws and policies govern their activities. 

Here's another great example https://youtu.be/2qZJtTwUKpw while these videographers may be goons, just look at the reaction of this woman who tries to intimidated these guys. Seems like that woman is a hardcore authoritarian with a self-importance complex. As soon as this woman has a camera pointed at her face, she admits what the building is and that the Oregon TITAN Fusion Center. Which, by the way is location at 610 Hawthorne Ave., Suite 210 Salem, OR 97301.  *It's on Google FFS* - this video is the first result when you Google Oregon Titan. What did she think she was protecting by engaging some Sovereign Citizens and sheepishly walking away 60 seconds later? ***That's a leader in our counter-terrorism division.***

Or, my favorite example of incompetence: their official URL https://ortitan.org has lapsed, their public facing website and all of their reports are down - lots of government agencies link to this URL. How goddamn incompetent do you have to be? 

We have to shut TITAN down. It's corrupt. It's worthless. It's contributing the long horrid legacy of being an active part of the Red Squad.

If DOJ and the Government of Oregon thinks there's merit to continuing this type of Criminal Investigation Center then it should be possibly reopened with a more diverse workforce. Like people under the age of 35 who might understand that black liberals are not terrorists. There not only needs to be clear policies about what is rule of law in Oregon, but also rotating staff so that no one Analyst becomes embedded with too much power. As the military has shown, it's not necessary to be a 10+ year veteran of law enforcement to be a good intelligence analyst, we train 18 year olds to carry out this task.

Today in 2019 I'm sure the priority of the OTFC has shifted from ""Black Lives Matter"" to researching the ""Antifa"" and ""Patriot Prayer"" and the ""Proud Boys"" - how many months have they had to identify criminal activity? How many youtube videos need to be published by either side showing wrong doing? If ""Black Lives Matter"" and Seattle based vegans represented worthwhile efforts for the Fusion Center, you can be sure that anything you're posting online about Antifa and the Proud Boys is being monitored. I'm conflicted about if this is a good or bad thing that they're too incompetent to do anything about it.

##**Not Just Oregon's Problem**

[That 2012 bipartisan federal report](https://www.csoonline.com/article/2223243/microsoft-subnet/fusion-centers-don-t-find-terrorists--filled-with--crap--that-violates-privacy.html) on Fusion Centers across the country found that **all of them** are worthless. None are contributing meaningfully to counter-terrorism and none can even justify their own existence - worse, some have disrupted actual counter-terrorism actions. Every ""alert"" put out by a Fusion Center has been without merit and often wastes resources. But most importantly of all: in example after example the personal bias of intelligence analysis has been used as a justification for law enforcement actions.",

Too much racial bias?

Unarmed black people getting shot on camera couldn't keep up with the shit Trump's been tweeting

People realized that their narratives were based on lies

They're mainly concentrating on the infiltration of Pride parade committees.

The roles kinda switched besides the racism but most black people are doing better than white people now the only thing they fight is the stupid amount of racism that comes from white people

All lives matter is a bullshit counter to divert attention away from BLM.

Authoritarians use chaos to cover up the shit they're doing

Lol black people are doing better than white people? Wut?

What? Are you implying that I say they don't matter? Or that I don't think everyone has their own problems? Don't just assume stuff dude.

The average african american makes half of what a white American makes.  Maybe he is including asians and middle easterners into his stats because you know all people of color are the same.  Both parties are retarded btw.

I'm not saying that white people are at a total loss I'm just saying that black people have been doing better in some aspects

He's absolutely right. They're more rich, more successful, and more likely to be racists against whites than the other way around but as usual another redditor blinded by the liberal media.

""Black lives matter"" doesn't mean they matter more than others. It's saying ""black lives matter, stop fucking shooting them""

This account is a liberal troll man stay careful

K

This year, 143 White people have been shot and killed by police. 6 were unarmed. Next, 102 Black people were shot by police. 5 were unarmed. It seems to me like the problem ain't so big anymore, or that they really don't have it worse than the ""priveleged"". Honestly, I don't think all police are the best. But most try really hard, and are great at being a good and valuable member in American society. (Source is the Washington Post)

Dude said ""more rich""

lmao go cry to your mommy Rachel Maddow and stop trying to destroy this glorious country with your lies

Theres more to it than that raw data. There might be more white deaths by police, but when taking into account the percentage of the population that's black vs white, people of color are killed at a higher rate than whites.

They are more rich. Look at Jay Z, Puff Daddy, Kanye, Beyonce, Lebron, Michael Jordan, Oprah. What do they all have in common besides being filthy rich? It certainly isn't their genders

Troll account

But who's to say it's because they're black? There's a very high chance none of them, Whites and people of color, are done because of racists. It's simply either accidents happen, or that even though it says ""unarmed"", that could still mean they were attacking the policeman. You can't always assume the worst because it benefits your argument.

""More rich"" lol.  Dude go to google and type in richest people in America and tell me when you find the first black dude.  Hint its a chick and she is 298 on the list.

Ahh the usual ""RUSSIAN TROLL"" cry from the Left. There was no collusion even your daddy Robert Mueller said so. When will you accept that and Shillary's loss?

You also can't ignore the systemic trend in which laws are made and enforced that disproportionately affect people of color. This is a system that for nearly 200 years actively worked to oppress people. It's gone on for generations. The civil rights act was 60 years ago. People are still alive today from when everything was segregated. Kids raised to prefer segregation and Jim crow laws are alive today, and could be cops. They could be in the legislative process. They can be in the court system. Its naive to think that there isn't still huge room for improvement to undo these unjust systems. Theres many factors from policy, enforcement, legal interpretations, finance laws contributing to generational poverty, I could go... that need to be addressed. But black lives matter is able to fit on a poster.

Edit: a word

but that rich black chick is richer than most white people in America and frankly rest of the world

Where did I say Russian? You're still a troll

People who believe in those dumb shit Jim Crow laws are probably Too old to be in the police force. People who grew up believing that are probably pretty old. I'm just saying it's reasonable to think that not everyone is racist. Not all Black deaths are caused by racism. MOST black deaths are not caused by racism. I'm willing to bet that this year, no black person was killed by a Cop racist against blacks. That's how much I believe in people. Believe in good. Maybe you should, as I stated earlier, not assume the worst in a situation.

That is one person.  Are you saying no black person should have more money than any white person?  The average black dude in America makes half of what the average white person makes.  Either you are a troll or dumb as fuck.

Actually, as we saw in your previous lie filled post to the original comment, you are the true troll here. A troll that is hellbent on dividing our glorious nation. I suggest you stop being fed lies from CNN

>People who believe in those dumb shit Jim Crow laws are probably Too old to be in the police force

No, they're prime age for old asshole still in the Senate. 

It's not that I think everyone is racist or every cop is a racist, it's that the system is still rigged. It still needs fixing. To ignore the injustice is just as harmful as perpetrating it. Yeah, you can have that optimism, but you still need to push for better.

the average hip hop basketball black person makes more than the average white person especially when respective fields are compared. This is incorrect as usual blacks have been proven by multiple studies to have more per capita wealth than whites. simple facts

People who believe in that stuff are a minority, and if they're elected they're obviously hiding it. Nobody will let them pass any laws any laws like that ever again. Or they'll be shipped out as soon as you can say Tuscaloosa.

Troll for sure.  Give me one reference for your ""facts"".

Doesn't matter if they're a minority if theyre in power, dude. Ever heard of apartheid? Ever wonder how slavery was enforced when blacks outnumbered white people in slave states? Jesus

there's this thing called Google

There was enormous pressure from outside countries for apartheid. And now everyone knows slavery and racism is wrong, except the minority that were raised on thinking it was good. Nobody is dumb enough to believe that stuff now.

Yea you should try using it sometime

I do its just I wish you would too so you could rise above your liberal haze

**Help Trio Thrive As The First 100% Black Owned Vegan Restaurant In Minneapolis**  


Three years ago, Louis Hunter was facing a whopping twenty years in prison for unjust charges related to his presence at a #BlackLivesMatter protest in the Twin Cities. He was at risk of losing his life, freedom and being taken away from his four daughters, family and beloved community. For two years, Louis continued to proclaim his innocence and fought to get his charges dropped, to no avail. During this traumatic time, Louis lost his car, his lawn care business, and his housing, as a result of his pending charges.  


Just weeks before his trial, a local couple, Sarah and Dan Woodcock, heard his story and felt compelled to get involved. Sarah and Dan worked with local Black Lives Matter (BLM) leaders and allies to rally the community to help fight Louis’ bogus charges. After a concerted effort, all of Louis’s charges were miraculously dismissed.   


In the aftermath of his charges being dropped, Louis approached Sarah and Dan about launching a food truck business. That idea spawned a partnership that resulted in the creation of [Trio plant-based](https://www.trioplantbased.com/) , a brick and mortar restaurant that serves healthy, delicious vegan food, located in Minneapolis. Trio was launched over a year ago through personal contributions of the owners, the support of our local community, and advocates and allies for racial justice from around the nation. In keeping with its focus on racial equity and justice, Trio has created numerous job opportunities, including for people of color and provide their employees with a living wage.  


A couple of months ago, Sarah and Dan made the difficult, personal decision to step back from Trio and to transfer full ownership to their former partner, Louis, as reparations. The transfer of ownership to Louis means that he operates the only 100% Black-owned vegan restaurant in the state of Minnesota. This is a reason to celebrate. Louis has an incredible opportunity to ensure the growth and sustainability of Trio, but he urgently needs our help.  


Owning a restaurant is already a challenging endeavor. However, in addition to the traditional challenges, Louis has had to contend with being an African American man who has had contact with the criminal justice system in a state that has some of the worst racial disparities in the nation between Blacks and Whites. This includes disparities in lending practices by the major banks. As a result, Louis will need the support of our entire community to ensure that Trio will operate successfully for many years to come.  


If you believe in racial, restorative and economic justice we need you to believe in Louis and Trio now more than ever. To get Trio to a place of strong financial positioning and stability, Louis needs to raise a total of $150,000 within the next 60 days, with an urgent need of $30,000 in the first 30 days of this campaign.   


**We can do it! It must be done. So, let’s do it!**   


The money raised will be used for paying off business debts, employee salaries, professional development fees (so Louis can excel as a leader), and operational expenses. The funds will provide a financial cushion, as Trio prepares to become one of the most successful black owned businesses in the state of Minnesota.   


Please give what you can frequently and consistently throughout the campaign. All funds will go directly to support [Trio](https://www.trioplantbased.com/) . Feel free to share this campaign with your family, friends and colleagues. Thanks in advance for your love and support. We appreciate your contributions. Now let’s make it happen.   


**\*Please keep in mind that each donation has a 2.9% transaction fee + a $0.30 fee. We suggest you add that back into your donation so Trio receives your full donation. \***

&#x200B;

No real explanation for why the $150,000 is needed, though.

I'm confused, did they give him a functioning business as reparations, or did they say he could keep a failed business that's apparently got $150,000 worth of debts and can't pay the living wage salaries of its workers? Normally a viable business would take care of its own debts, living wage salaries and personal development for the owner.

You're asking for $150,000 as pure donations, because banks don't give black people business loans? That doesn't make a whole lot of sense, *(edit) surely the actual reason he isn't getting loans is the masses of business debts that the business is unable to repay*? 

If it's genuinely a viable business, and a loan would get it where it needs to be, wouldn't there be plenty of investors? He apparently has no criminal record, so I don't see why the police thing would be an issue, and venture capitalists only care about whether a business is viable. 

But yet they're genuinely asking fora massive $150,000 in donations?

Mate even the Palestinian dad trying to get his van fixed so he can continue to sell vegetables on Kiva asked for a loan. I lent him $25, and the rest of Kiva lent him another few grand, and he did it and repaid us. My guess is that the troubles of a Palestinian fruit seller go beyond not being convicted of a crime and then somehow being given a business.

WHO THE FUCK CARES IF IT IS BLACK OWNED.

I never said progressives are not involved in violence, that’s a straw man argument: 

I said progressives *do not support violence*. 

You can count on one hand the amount of “attacks” committed by “the left”on a yearly basis, it’s non existent- they virtually don’t happen. 

You are not debating in good faith, so I’m done talking to you.

Black americans are obsest with the past and the historical use of the word n****r because of slavery. Or atleast their perception that because it was used in slave times that whites as a whole are not allowed to use it. And they also use history to enduce white guilt upon all whites. 

Then they turn around and use it on eachother in either endearing or hateful manner.

Really its just them practicing racism and giving special powers to a word. When the word is portugese for black.

In the same vein, not referring to your boss, teacher or whatever as ""Asshole"" or ""Bitch"" makes you a classist. If words have no power, then why are so many white people adamant in wanting to say it? It seems that they are giving power to a word as well.

I think you make a valid point.  If everyone could use it, maybe no one would use it.

You don't seem to have your facts straight, the portugese word for black (adj) is *negro* or *negra*, but the n-word in its current state which OP is talking about, while derived from all these words (latin, spanish, etc.), is only *derived*. It's not like the n-word with a hard R exists in any language with a comparable meaning.

I gues white ppl want to use it cuz we black ppl are so cool and whites have been copying our culture for a while.

What were you expecting you racist nigger hater?

Merely let them know you're white or just don't toe the line, you'll get trolled with Steve Huffman's ban tools on Steve Huffman's website, by Steve Huffman's moderators. 

If that boy ran a restaurant the way he runs his website, he wouldn't last a month. But here we are 15 years later.....

Yea, I'd agree with you.

But it IS stupid. I'm apparently not allowed to call black people ""blacks"", lol. What kind of shit is that? What else are we supposed to call them? I remember a time when they didn't even like being called African-Americans, because not ALL black people are from Africa.

I swear, we can't win. Well, we can. And we are. But in a societal sense, we can't win. As white people, we'll always be made to feel like shit for literally no reason at all. Like it's a crime to be born white these days. And unless we sympathize with them, then we're racists as well.

BLM has burned down a lot more than that.

Haha. Yea, I'm so racist because I get upset at other people's racism.

Go away, troll. Aren't you due at LiveLeak right about now to make fun of some people who died tragically?

Holy shiet, you just said NIGGER now im gonna Downvote

It’s just a really smart political tactic. Feminism does it too. You can’t win. No matter how much women and minorities will receive, they will still SCREAM that they are oppressed. They’ve placed white people and men into a bad position. If you disagree, they will call you racist or a misogynist, and nobody wants to be known as a racist or misogynist. Now the big thing is to just call you a straight up nazi. And again, nobody wants to be known as a fucking “nazi,” so they start conforming and the rest get written off and deplatformed. 

Oh and by calling you names they force you to go on the defensive. Then you have to explain how you aren’t a fucking nazi. Apparently, the very fact that you have to explain and defend yourself means you must be a nazi. They move the goalposts.

I see what your saying but let me throw in my perspective. White people are still the most privileged of races. The most discrimination you'll get is online where people will talk shit on you. But in real life, being colored can really give you a disadvantage against white people. Police feel a lot more comfortable around you, jobs are a lot easier to find, people don't call you slurs often, and so on and so forth.

I can atleast accept my own racism. Youre on your own level of dillusion. You were begging to be banned for what you posted but youre either too autistic or too far up your own ass to realize what you did wrong. Hope i see you soon on liveleak, hopefully some sort of carnival ride malfunction.

Free speech protects against government prosecution. It does not guarantee a platform to hate groups.

BLM is not the black equivalent of the KKK.

The KKK should be exterminated by the state because they are a terrorist group with a well documented history of organized lynching.

Well it's good that that's not how the first amendment works, imo

why should racism be tolerated?

pro tip, it shouldn't be.

Unpopular

But universities do because they gauruntee a platform to any group and aren't allowed to decide what's a hate group and what isn't.

Well, perhaps not in a university, and definitely not on private property or private events.  

But if it's a public platform...yes, it does do that.

Assholes love to use false equivalencies because it's an easy talking point for them and people don't like to listen to and learn about the nuances of most subjects

The Supreme Court of the United States disagrees.

A university is allowed to decide what behavior aligns with the school's platform. Remember that universities are also looking for money b/c they're businesses and if they are giving support to hate groups, they are likely to lose business.

Says who? They most certainly are allowed to decide who they give a platform to.

Just graduated from university of Connecticut, we had multiple individuals given platforms that were not from hate groups per say but certainly their messages purported hate along various different lines. The platforms given to these individuals caused a lot of backlash but was still done so and at a considerably liberal university too

Is something missing because it looks like just 6 million African Americans have died in the past 45 years.  That’s really, really amazing longevity.

Oh my

The numbers seem reeeeeeeallly stretched. Plus, abortion is not murder.

You are missing the point. 

Imagine a white supremacist in power. They think to themselves: 

“Hmmm... How can I decrease the black population? Well, from the state of things, I can’t just go around and kill them in masses. Ah! I have an idea! I can just kill them before they are born. Even better, I can give them the ‘right’ to do it themselves.”

There are more abortions of black babies than there are whites babies, and there are far more white women than black women. 

I’m even sympathetic to a woman’s right to choose, but you cannot deny the racial inequalities when it comes to this.

It could be if it wasn't murdered 🤷🏻‍♂️

Edit: your subreddit silences wrongthink, so I can't reply. But basically there is no flattering argument for abortion, bitch yo vagina is haunted ain't nobody in to that

So now, because more black women CHOOSE to have an abortion than white women, that’s somehow all just a white supremacist ploy? What are you smoking?

Sounds like no

So...according to these numbers, Black people, if abortion was illegal since 1973...would outnumber white people by now...cool.

Sounds good to me, Im sure the conseratives will be on board.

You guys dont mind being Minorities right? Its not like we put them in cages or anything!

Jun 10, 2016 | 28:51","Has anyone else noticed YouTube is now sticking 2 commercials at the front of videos instead of one?

Know why? 

Because half the stuff on YouTube has been demonetized, so they had to double up the commercials on what's left! :P Thanks! Remember to tip your waitresses! My merch is in the back!

Actually, that might be true!  The silver lining of demonetization is we can enjoy demonetized content WITH NO COMMERCIALS!!!

It's a WIN for the viewer of anti-SJW content. But if you like fake news and cat videos? You're screwed.

Youtube: hey welcome to this great place to host videos that could never appear on television like the wardrobe malfunction 

Youtube: ya know what you’ve helped us grow our platform so much like a lot so we’re gonna give you some our our profits from the ad revenue 

Youtube: we are being bought out by google.  Later

Youtube:  so our advertisers aren’t really please that our content isn’t family friendly.  Yes we’ve pushed the advertisers that would love to advertise with you off the platform but you gotta understand we suck at PR.

Youtube: we’re not censoring conservatives we’ve only demonetized you

Youtube: we haven’t banned you, just some of the most conservative videos that make Democrat and leftist propaganda look bad

Youtube: you’re still here?  Take a fucking clue.

By the way, they almost worded their hate speech rules in a way that ALL Crowder videos could be removed because MugClub gives discounts to veterans.

https://youtube.googleblog.com/2019/06/our-ongoing-work-to-tackle-hate.html

> Today, we're taking another step in our hate speech policy by specifically prohibiting videos alleging that a group is superior in order to justify discrimination, segregation or exclusion based on qualities like age, gender, race, caste, religion, sexual orientation or veteran status.

Veterans are a protected class. 🤷🏻‍♂️

134,anon_y_2000,Confessions of a paranoid lurker regarding the state of internet/nerd culture and its ugliness.,4,c6arel,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/c6arel/confessions_of_a_paranoid_lurker_regarding_the/,4,2019-06-28 12:43:46,"Firstly, this is going to be a exceptionally long post.  

&#x200B;

That's mostly due to the fact I've never admitted these feelings before and i want them to be known in full.

&#x200B;

now I'll give a quick introduction to myself

&#x200B;

\>male

\>19

\>visible ethnic minority

\>Jewish

\>autistic

\>social recluse

\>very much paranoid

&#x200B;

although this is a obvious throwaway account i have been on reddit as a lurker for a good seven years.

&#x200B;

I was introduced to reddit by a schoolmate telling me about his favorite minecraft memes.

&#x200B;

as folks might remember reddit was a very very different place seven years ago, much more left wing-libertarian sort of outlook and for the most part it was pleasant and i came on semi-weekly to laugh at memes and whatnot.

&#x200B;

then came 2014, and reddit on 2014 could be remembered if nothing else for gamergate and the shooting of Micheal Brown. 

&#x200B;

Now regardless of what people say today, gamergate was most definitely at first nowhere near racist and what virtually all of us wanted was basically less censorship.  I still have very very fond memories being emboldened by the idea of the #notyourshield movement (as i look back it was pretty cringy) it felt honestly good as a ethnic minority to go against the msm grain and say ""i won't let fear dictate my political opinions"". 

&#x200B;

now the shooting of Micheal Brown had numerous effects on my life online and offline.

mainly due to the fact that Ferguson was only a fifteen mile drive north from my neighborhood.

at first i had no opinion of the matter being a fourteen year old. then i was flooded with all the images of the rioting and calls for violence and i felt disgusted.

However what really got me in all honesty was that i was part of my high-school debate team and my teacher had to suddenly announce that the yearly mock trial session that i had been waiting for the past month was called off due to blacklivesmatter protesters illegally surrounding the courthouse.

That got me mad, Really REALLY mad. (Again looking back there is a lot of validity to the saying that people don't care about things unless it happens to them).

&#x200B;

i ended up starting to lurk on  both 4chan and 8chan for  a good eight hours of my day listening too all of the batshit crazy rhetoric and starting to honestly spew it out.

&#x200B;

I have a couple rancid memories of actually going up to blm protesters and screaming right alongside the hillbillies.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

i was a racist for a good half-year rambling about black people notwithstanding my half-black brother.

&#x200B;

I put 4chan/8chan/KIA/TiA on a cult like pedestal. and continued to position my thinking as basically ""not one of those other minorities"".

&#x200B;

Then came the election of Donald Trump.

&#x200B;

The first thing that happened to me after that is associate of my dad's  and someone pretty close to me literally skipped town that very night. (i later found out that he was in fact  undocumented and he went nuts after finding out about the election results).

&#x200B;

the second thing that happened was that /pol/ starting talking about this weirdo named Richard Spencer and how he made some rambling pro-trump speech going ""heil our people"".

&#x200B;

as usual for a selfish brat like myself, i didn't think much of it.  

&#x200B;

then suddenly everything got weird.

&#x200B;

rather then talk about ""muh sjw bullshit"" KiA/TiA started talking about shit like ""culture wars"" and ""the anti-white media""

as well at that time somebody at my local school ended up sending a snap of him doing the roman salute.

&#x200B;

i started to get a little concerned at that moment but i kept telling myself ""oh this is just a vocal minority"".

&#x200B;

then suddenly i saw my father on the local news yelling at trump's trade tariffs and how he has to pay a 50% up charge in avocados. 

&#x200B;

I also had a ill-fated conversation with my brother which ended with him calling me a ""racist piece of shit"" which made me feel absolutely terrible.

&#x200B;

so through my emotional confusion there was the Charlottesville rally. and all of a sudden beyond all of the ""you will not replace us"" i heard multiple people (e-celebs/legitimate political pundits) start to actually defend them.

That's when alarm bells started to ring in my head and i took a month long break from the internet to sort myself out.

&#x200B;

and then when i went back to all of my formerly favorite subreddits i was horrified, all i saw was the very identity politics that i had assumed we were rallying against. 

by then i just said ""Fuck it I'll tune out from politics"" and i ended up getting really into anime/manga for a while.

&#x200B;

but even then after a while even the weeaboo community became identitarian and i felt absolutely shunned. (and still somewhat confused for obvious reasons).

now for me, venturing outside of my Midwestern home has become a mental chore now dealing with all of the newfound glares, so i've  become a NEET while personally unable to enjoy any manga/anime without downing a bunch of anti-depressants and telling myself that the scantranslators probably don't want to send me to special camp. (A bit melodramatic on my part).

as well i've started measuring obsessively the ratios for white nationalist posts on reddit and twitter and  kept repeating to myself how ""small""they are. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I now live in a country where i vote out of fear and not out of any moral conviction.

&#x200B;

I'm sorry if this is sloppy,

&#x200B;

Thank you.","It's a fairly well-written confession of your regression back to being a useful pawn. It would have been even more so if it was true.

https://i.imgur.com/8W8bYPC.jpg

Should be enough confirmation

No, I dont assume you're instantly beyond reproach because you're a minority.

If you aren't comfortable calling the name out, don't do it. That simple.

Someone recently ordered under ""Nger"". The shift didn't allow anyone to say the name, or even put the sticker on the items.

We had a blacklivesmatter the other day

One of our cringey regulars found out he could change his name in mobile and tried to change it to include the r-word, it wouldn’t let him. He tried to complain to me about it. Nah, man. Ain’t doing that.

yet apparently sexy is not an allowed name on POS.

En-jur

You also can't type in ""Chris"" (or any variations) or ""Ryan"".

What? This isn't true, lol

It might just be in the ""ask me"", but I swear it's true. We have a regular named Ryan, and trying to type in his name in the drive thru just enters an ""ask me"" instead of his name.

Why are you putting the name in the ask me?

Because the drive thru doesn't offer an option to put a name in, and our DM insists we get names. Also hi, way late reply?

I didn’t knooow. My store didn’t have a drive through. Also yeah idk how I ended up here

139,Babescake,Why isn't mental illness considered a #metoo or #blacklivesmatter moment?,6,c2oirl,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/c2oirl/why_isnt_mental_illness_considered_a_metoo_or/,15,2019-06-20 15:40:15,,"Why isn't there a mental health movement like #metoo or #blacklivesmatter? Why is there still such a stigma here and an inability to catch up to be trendy? No offense, once you trend, you can create more impact.

I imagine what this movement would need is a catalyst that is separate from other established movements. 

In America the only time mental health seems to get much discussion is when it’s lumped into the gun control debate. Being hooked onto a topic like that doesn’t do much to propel an overall discussion on mental health   

There have been many celebrities with mental illness but often times it isn’t discussed until after we have gawked at erratic behavior for a while which seems to lessen how much sympathy people have for the subject

I think there is a stigma associated with getting mental help.  That stigma needs to be erased, there are a lot of people suffering silently because they don't want people to think they are either crazy or over dramatic.  I've seen it happen too many times, and the consequences can be awful.

Maybe #erasethestigma as a hashtag, don't know what would make this catch on.

Because there isn’t a person to blame. You can’t really give that evil a face if that makes sense. Doesn’t sell as well I guess even though studies are showing mental illness affecting the lives of more and more people each year.

. #brokenbrainboys is the best I can come up with right now. I want to be inclusive of every gender but I also love alliteration

In Canada we have ""Bell Let's Talk"" day. There is a huge add campaign which encourages people to talk about mental health and people can donate money. However, some people still get mad when people they know use platforms to talk about mental health.

Have you been on reddit? Mental illness is romanticized here.

It certainly should be a movement! Remove the stigma of mental illness for good

Because no one cares.

It's about as easy as getting to the front page on Reddit. Eventually, someone will strike the right note and it would go viral, but it's not something you can do intentionally.

Let’s start it! We just need a catchy hashtag and a Twitter following...

.#stopthestigma maybe?

You can argue that the shitty system we live under is the cause for all the depression and other mental illnesses because of how alienating capitalism is as an economic system, and how if we moved towards a system where the workers control their means of production and weren't forced to live under a system where you have to work for someone shitty or die, this would improve, and tie mental health into the anti-capitalist movement.

A lot of cases of depression aren't caused by something being wrong with the brain but how fucked up our society is

True but they mentioned mental health in general, which is more encompassing than depression (some mental health disorders are genetic, some are society induced, and some are responses to your upbringing). Either way, the tag line just needs to be catchy to work

It's like lovingly watching Goonies/Stranger Things/etc happen to him. The adventures are so meaningful. We live in a recently-mostly-white, now more mixed neighborhood and thus his crew is mixed. His best friend is African American. How do I talk to him about how to (a) be safe and (b) advocate for his friend if/when the world gets caught up is his life. 

&#x200B;

I read about what happened in Arizona (little kid takes a dollar toy, mom ends up with gun in face), and the other injustices to blacks and and black youth. I want my son to stand up against this, but I'm afraid he'd get h̶u̶r̶t̶    killed doing this.",">I want my son to stand up against this,

I think a good place would to to ask you son what **he**wants and thinks about this.

You can have him ask his friend to share some of his fears and frustrations with racism and what he would like for your friend to do.

First, bravo on wanting to do the right thing. 

Second, ask him what he knows about not just the BLM, but injustices faced by POC throughout history and currently. Ask him if he's seen anything personally that he has questions about. Make it a topic he's aware of and feels safe talking about. 

While the suggestion to ask his friend about it might seem good, it's also putting the emotional labor on a a POC kid to explain racism. It'd be great if they can have those discussions, but they're also kids and limited in their experience in life. While the other kid likely does have experience with racism that he can talk about, your son should have some understanding before engaging.  Arm your son with some knowledge before encouraging him to ask his friend about it. There are great resources online for your son to read and watch. I think PBS might even have series about it for kids. 

Finally, for sure teach him to stand up and say something when he sees it happening.

Agree with all points. Self-determination for the black nation!

Damaging stores and property isn't the way to express your outrage and enact meaningful change.. Wouldn't it be more appropriate to trash a police station or something?

I worry that all damaging/looting does is give right wing reactionaries ammo against genuine progressive voices.

By all means be outraged. Just the attitude on this post and in the comments is going to kill movements like blm before they can succeed

Edit: thinking on my post overnight I want to make one addendum. Of course the sentiment of the post is awesome and absolutely is important. Any damage to private property should not be the focus of blm coverage.

[removed]

Threaten to kill your parents *in front of you and your baby sister*

FTFY. How fucked is that...

Breaking windows is not a PR move.

Attacking police stations put our people in harms way.

And fuck what reactionaries think. 

More info here: https://youtu.be/kqpjSLi2Cfg

They will be outraged no matter what they do

Right? Go protest outside the Police Union building,or station or even better the state capital. Why fuck up where people work and earn money to live.

""In surroundings of class slavery, it is difficult to teach the oppressed masses good manners. When provoked to fury they use clubs, stones, fire, and the rope. The court historians of the exploiters are offended at this.""
 - Trotsky

We get it youre a bootlicker that conflated legality with morality and seriously thinks workers are compensated when big stores sell their products. 

You're why we need centricide

 Aggressive and extreme protest is sometimes the only way to enact change, I get that. Just focus that outrage towards the institutions that perpetuate oppression. Randomly destroying what the public perceives as innocent peoples property only undermines the message you want to convey.

How dare they kneel!

I'm not saying use good manners ;) 

Extreme action needs to be enacted service of your goals. While of course in any popular cause things get messy, the visibility of the cause should always be most important. This doesn't mean the ""mess"" it's a good thing.

>socialism isn’t moral. It’s a cancer.

I thought capitalism was the one with infinite growth until its host  dies



Maybe I got those mixed up. My bad

[removed]

Do you know what socialism  is, or just what your high school teacher who totally lived in Ukraine said socialism means?


Cause you're either ignorant or a stvpid fucking troll.


Besides that is nothing at all like cancer. Humans get cancer all the time. It is human nature. So even by your faulty logic either capitalism is both human nature and cancerous. Socialism is both human nature and cancerous. Or neither are innately cancerous or related to the vague concept of ""human nature"" as we understand it today. There's no other way around that metaphor 

You'd have to prove some correlation of concepts

> human nature

We got ourselves a top mind in here, fellas!

He figured it out, so let's pack it up and lick boots.

[removed]

Misey and capitalism are correlated. Look at the united states for a current example. Have you even seen the suicide, murder, mental illness, or nihilism rates as class disparity increases? Talk about an unsustainable model

But a quick 101 since you don't seem to get socialism at its core premise. 


Marx never sought to demonize capitalism. He saw it as a teasnotionary stage between feudalism and socialism. With his end goal being communism which comes after socialism. The way he saw it was that each system evolves naturally as a result of competing class interests, until class itself ceases to exist. Within each system remnants of the past and seeds of the future exist. Socialism emerges when capitalism becomes obsolete.

[removed]

Yeah turns out rich people  making more money by exploiting more poor people  even harder is a negative thing for most people. 

You don't even understand what socialism or capitalsim for that matter is. You have no place lecturing me about ideological shortcomings.


I'm an anarchist, I actually reject Marxism. I just understand it. 

and often acknowledge that propaganda of the deed as often imagined has had a negative effect on the movement. Likewise critical of the ultra hippies that basically went liberal because muh ""hurting people is always bad"" were pretty shit for the cause too.

That's kind of a thing the left does. Learn from its past and continue to fight for a better future. Because guess what, history and  politics  didn't end in the 1980s.

Why can't you admit the shortcomings of capitalism? Is it because they can't be justified? Because you don't want to grow into a better version? Or because you know you can't

PS I'm an anarcho communist  transhumanist, not an anarcho primitivist individualist.  I've got my criricims of them too. Well individualists are cool 


How about you offer some solutions on how to make capitalism work for the people? Or are you incapable of admitting ideological shortcomings because capitalsim is in its dying thralls and leaves you with only corpses of progress?

All capitalism does anymore is take credit for whatever the workers do  as if it's actually relevant to the economic system

2: ""Sex"" is a word invented to have utility in describing all sexual variation.

3: Sex is typically defined as a binary that is set from birth, by social conservatives. I will call this the ""stuck binary"" model from here, not a technical term, just a clear phrase I made up just now.

4: Sexual variation is a binomial spectrum ([https://twitter.com/ScienceVet2/status/1035246030500061184](https://twitter.com/ScienceVet2/status/1035246030500061184)), partially made clear in intersex folks; or even that the same person can have 2 sets of chromosomes in the same body (XX & XY in different places, for example) or be infertile if you're basing your classification on gametes.

5: Transgender folks can (but don't always) change thier primary & secondary sexual characteristics with surgeries & medicine

6: Science cannot make claims that we **ought** to make a category but those participating in the creation of science can observe that something(s) exist(s).

Conclusion: Given premise 2, the utility of the word ""sex"" is diminished when used (as in 3) synonymously with the ""stuck binary"" model as it does not (4 & 5) accurately describe sexual varition as it is supposed to. Given 6 it is up to us whether we use a different word, redefine the word, or give up on having a word, as science cannot tell us from what does exist, how we **ought to** make categories from that data.

As I do not *want* to make the word ""sex"" entirely useless since it can still serve good utility describing sexual variation if redefined, sex **ought** be redefined as a spectrum with a binomial distribution in line with what is actually true about sexual variation, & be applied in such a way that the assignment is not static, in line with accurately representing the bodies with which we seek to apply the word.

Where you may disagree:

If you don't think the word ""sex"" **ought** to describe *all* sexual variation including modification of those sexual characteristics, that's an option (though it can & will & does have awful consequences for those who don't fit neatly into 2 option schema as detailed in the linked thread & in many places elsewhere), but you can't just defer to science & say it decides for you what you **ought** to do. People can make ought claims about categories & words, science (as far as it is the systematised description of reality) cannot. Only we can say ""this is that & this is this other thing & that is that other thing & you over there don't even get to say you have a sex"", categories weren't around before there were people to make them up.

**BUT**

This logic is too often circular (pointed out to me by this vid by 2 NB Polish socialists, ""Biological sex as a spectrum"" by TransGrysy: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igjhN5puQIk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igjhN5puQIk), it's English subbed & I urge you to subscribe to them & donate to them if you can afford it since the leftist presence is much lesser in Poland) where transgender folks & intersex folks are disregared as abberations or failures of nature or similar as justification for not changing the model of sex from the ""stuck binary"" model to something actually representative of sexual variation, but the only reason this is said is because they differ from the ""stuck binary"" model. It justifies the model on the basis that the model is currently used, which is frankly ridiculous circular logic.

# Important miscellany

Trigger warnings, virtue signalling & ""problematic"" are commonly misunderstood, sexual promiscuity is seen as inherently bad by many, ""it's just like 1984!!"" is commonly misused, words have power, & social construction claims are commonly misunderstood, Trump is shit, soy is good actually, offensiveness is not the measure by which you should measure the worth of an opinion nor is fallacious reasoning a good measure for whether to deal with an issue or not. Antifascism is not terrorism, & left wing terrorism is minimal, the opposites of which are both stupid views & widely held. Social science is real science & I'd personally argue it's necessary to meaningfully analyse the world. Pinkwashing is garbage.

What a fake ass bitch.

And he calls himself Duplicitous. How very appropriate.

This post is so mind numbingly ignorant that i laughed out loud reading it. Downvote and move along ladies and gentlemen.

You must've read that laughable Vice article.

LGBTQ+ doesn't have to be included in everything. Simply by stating that a developer must include some assets to please a group of people is the exact kind of behavior the group is fighting against.  Stop blaming police as a whole. Its narrow minded. ( another thing the community is supposed to be against.)  I would be cool to see some LGBTQ stuff in there but OP needs to stop acting like they are entitled to something. You're not.

This is the stupidest thing I ever read.

What would a skin like that look like? Soldier in a leather thong and high heels?

how is this shitpost not deleted? Are there no mods in this sub?

Shit post

Anything that offends you ridiculous virtue signaling phonies is fine by me.

It's just a skin.

If you live your whole life pretending you’re a victim, you’re going to be a victim.

Would it be ok if Brigitte was black? Isn't it racist to make it ok only if her skin is of a certain color?

Get over yourself since when do games need to be inclusive of LGBTQ anyways why does a video game characters SEXUALITY MATTER when all they do is shoot other people. Let the characters yers and skins be just that and quit trying to make EVERYTHING have some kind of hidden agenda or meaning. Its fucking frustrating that people wanna sjw shit that had no need. I play games to escape that kind of.bullshit not have it shoved back down my throat. I'm all for everyone loving who they want but in a multiplayer shooter it truly has no place. BLM was a terrible example as they were actively rioting and causing traffic problems. If anyone needed mace to the face it was them

I don't feel like it was they're intention and honestly don't see the big deal. I am 100% equal rights and am completely on your side when it comes to that but in my opinion you're over thinking it.

I... I can’t tell if you’re being serious or not.

You know two of the most popular characters are gay right?

I respectfully think you are drastically reaching to make a point baised on a preconcieved bias with little grounding in reality.

Edit: phone typing :[

Oh I found that vice article I loved how they used police deaths ( from what i can tell this number includes justified kills )

What Vice article?

Oh and:

>No, you entitled little brat. That's not how this is going to go. You don't get to make demands and hold your own children for ransom. Keep your damn legs closed if you can't deal with the consequences.

You are absolutely vile and pathetic, most of the replies in here appear to be children who can't read, but you are truly a heinous little goblin.

Just so the people reading along can see the caliber of human being who thinks as you do.

> I play games to escape that kind of.bullshit not have it shoved back down my throat.

Maybe other people don't want a riot cop swinging at them ""shoved back down (their) throat"" when they go to escape into an ostensibly lighthearted fantasy video game.

Your lack of empathy is gross.

> You know two of the most popular characters are gay right?

Re-read the title, this is regarding Overwatch the game, not their comics or whatever.

Yeah, what? Overwatch has way better gay representation than 99% of games out there.

There is nothing ambiguous at all about my point, I spelled it out rather explicitly.

> What Vice article?

HAHAHAHAHAHA, get the fuck out of here.  You're so full of shit.

I stand by everything I said to that baby killer. And you're a lying snake. You know exactly what article I'm talking about you miserable lying thief.

> Your lack of empathy is gross.

You're lack of common sense is gross.

I have plenty of empathy. But I can also seperate fantasy from reality. It's a game u gonna cry a river over rainbow six siege riot cop uniforms too?  I see a game I dont see an oppressive riot cop skin I just see a riot cop skin. I dont personally like cops  but I'm not triggered when officer dva bombs my ass. Grow up or dont play the game quit being so fragile that a skin upsets you so badly. It is what it is. It's not like her ultimate makes her scream fuck BLM. It's a skin that fits her since she has a personal shield it makes absolute sense and was not implemented out of malice. YOU are making an agenda where there isnt one. It's not my lack of empathy but your lack of any kind of exterior toughness. I bet grains of sand cause you to have catastrophic meltdowns. With all the mass shooters soldier 76 and reaper should be removed right? how dare they use guns XD how dare dva use a bomb or tracer or junkrat since the Boston bombings.

Your ignorance is quite obvious, as the comics and all that are canon.

This is a multiplayer only game.   All of the lore is displayed via the comics and it's all canon.

...

The literal face of Overwatch is a passionate lesbian and you’re mad because the game itself isn’t flamboyant about it?

I agree. It is unambiguously stupid and explicitly hilarious. 🤣🤣🤣

I just googled for it and skimmed it, it's poorly written, and that you honestly think this is such an original idea that it had to be stolen speaks volumes about your own intellectual capacity.

> You're lack of common sense is gross.

Your

You've managed to miss a point which was spelled out in very plain English using small words.

Have you ever read a book that didn't have wizards or space ships in it?

> I just googled for it and skimmed it, it's poorly written

Pot, meet Kettle.

> that you honestly think this is such an original idea that it had to be stolen speaks volumes about your own intellectual capacity.

No, I don't think it's an ""original idea"".  But I find the fact that you both refer to the brand new Brigitte skin as a ""symbol for oppression"" to be hardly a coincidence.  You just changed it from race to LGBTQ+ nonsense...

Yeah. That's the ticket. You're already a laughingstock, a liar and a plagiarist. Might as well add smug and transparently dim witted to the list. You're a fucking joke. A clown. A bottom feeding goon.

Really?  You can't think of a decent argument that you have to resort to correcting a typo?  What are you, 12?

Have you even played the game? It’s full of lgbt representation yet you’re trying to try and get pissed about a skin of a riot control officer for a character that literally has a riot shield. Tracer is lesbian and there’s a whole comic about it too. Saying that’s not relevant to the game is like saying lore isn’t relevant in Skyrim, that is LITERALLY the story you’re ignoring.

You honestly have such a lack of imagination that you believe nobody out of the millions of people who play Overwatch could possibly believe the same thing?

For realsies, what I wrote is in very plain English, your lack of comprehension and inability to grasp the underlying context informing this position only reveal that you are in no way equipped to seriously engage with it. 

You aren't equipped to argue here, simply downvote and move on if you aren't willing to read.

I read your nonsense and have determined it to be nonsense... because it's nonsense.

Aren't equipped, he says! 🤣 That's fucking rich. This isn't profound, it's pathetic. You stole it from a notorious SJW tabloid and you don't even have the decency to admit it. You're fake, two faced and smug. A wholly unappealing combination of traits. Fuck off.

171,,r/offmychest A theoretically politically neutral subreddit that fails to be so,2,bry12y,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/bry12y/roffmychest_a_theoretically_politically_neutral/,6,2019-05-23 19:00:40,[deleted],"[deleted]

1. Any large enough subreddit develops a circlejerk, where orthodox opinions are encouraged and unorthodox opinions are discouraged.
2. Politics attract more polarization, but it isn't is not a special matter in this. It could be anything, even ""cilantro lovers"" vs. ""cilantro haters"". 
3. A politically engaged *and homogeneous* moderation team, lacking diversity to manage a subreddit where people post about political stuff. 
4. r/offmychest works as a support group, so it's an environment you'd rather avoid criticism. This means debating - that requires showing opposite views - is strongly frowned upon.
5. Autobanning people based on the subreddits they post almost screams ""I don't care about the community, and I'm too lazy to do proper moderation"". (I wouldn't be surprised if T_D did the same, it's right up their childish alley.)

Couple all of those things together and you have a recipe for a subreddit that fails to achieve its original purpose (allow people to vent off), that pretends to be politically engaged without being an actual political sub (because this would require discussion).

OP might not be bashing r/offmychest, but I am. It's a shithole, an echo chamber, and it stinks stupidity from a distance, *even if my own political opinions aren't that different from the orthodox opinions in that sub*.

Planning on making a similar post on a right leaning subreddit, already have some in mind. Depends on the reception of this post.

A month ago, I got banned from offmychest due to my commenting on another subreddit. The context will be added if asked, but it's nothing special. I'm not on reddit often and banning due to activity elsewhere seems very sketchy to me, I don't know how common it is. Thanks for the insight, it explains some things. Maybe there could be something built in the future that shows the political leanings of all 'nonpolitical' subreddits so people like me aren't thrown a curveball ban.

It's the exact same story with r/confessions, r/unpopularopinion, r/rants, etc. If you actually use these subreddits like you're supposed to, you get shit on.

This is the solution to the /r/offmychest problem. That sub is a cancer.

I honestly fail to see the point of this post nor what you're trying to achieve.

If #whitelivesmatter signs went down the road people would be pissed.

Only a fucking idiot would be offended by the phrase “black lives matter” and read it as “black lives matter more.” Idiots who say “all lives matter” are probably the dumbest imaginable. Just try to think if you were trying to find your seat and you asked an usher where it was and they replied that all seats are everywhere. And then the traitors who say “blue lives matter” just need to be straight up executed.

Honestly, black lives don’t matter. Nor do white lives and Asian lives.

You’re all worthless, wretched, hairless apes with a propensity for self-aggrandising bullshit and arrogance beyond the capabilities of any other animal.

All lives matter.  I watched a social experiment on YT where a dude in NYC held a sign that said all lives matter and legit dumb ass, non intelligent hood rats slapped the sign out of his hands and told him to leave and get off their block.   That's literally a HUGE part of the problem.   Yeah slavery was a thing, 100 YEARS AGO.  Get over it. They act like whites owe them when in all reality, whites don't owe blacks anything.  If slavery wasn't a thing, half the African Americans of today would still be poverty stricken lion hunters.

Should be #alllivesmatter

It should have been ""black lives also matter"".

Who’s saying black lives don’t matter? Are you really that stupid?

Didn't know this was a thing already, weil guess I'll use google beforhand next time..

It is.

Seriously nowadays nobody except old hags care. We’re all just people, #blacklivesmatter is literally trying to segregate. #alllivesmatter makes much more sense.

Kramer starts a “black mail service”, but won’t give out any details when anyone asks about it—instead telling jerry, “haven’t your people profited enough off of the hard work of the black man?!” 

Newman is concerned that Kramer is creating a competing mail service and breaks into Kramer’s apartment, where he finds that Kramer is actually just using black envelopes instead of white.

Jerry sees Newman breaking into Kramer’s apartment, but waits for Kramer to get home, thinking he can use the blackmail service against Newman to force him to leave the building

[deleted]

BLM is and should always be relevant imo. Hip-Hop, at its origins- is a black dance/music form and as a white person I want to show my allyship and solidarity as clearly and boldly as possible.

BLM is also relevant to this subreddit, as intersectionality is an inherent consideration.

Same here

Blm deals with violence and injustice against the black community. Especially police shootings. It had nothing to do with hip hop unless the song was referring to injustices we face. I prefer ones to know what it means before putting a hashtag on anything. It’s not something to take lightly.

In addition- this Instagram account will be used to spread awareness and advocacy in whatever way it may present its usefulness. Each post will include these hashtags highlighting, not only the black community, but also wider intersections. Especially those that have to do with queerness and non-binary gender identities (two that I identify with). Our world needs a constant reminder that the lives of our vulnerable populations matter and this account is simply a way of accomplishing that.

I would tend to disagree but appreciate your thought. Black Lives Matter is an extension and part of the movement for black lives. While police violence is a major part of the movement for black lives (m4BL/BLM), it is much more than that. Hip hop has a surprising amount of correlation to the M4BL. Hip-Hop has been used and is being used as a medium to empower and spread awareness. The song in the video is obviously featuring Beyonce, a prominent woman of color in media. Her presence in media, as well as the way she presents herself is very indicative of US racial politics. I do not take BLM/M4BL lightly at all - I am just about to receive my degree in Africana Studies.

I prefer the hashtag to be used for a statement not some dance video. The hashtag isn’t a trend where you can just slap it on anything

I prefer to incorporate advocacy and recognition of the M4BL into all aspects of my life, including those that give me joy, like dance. You may see this as “some dance video”, but I see it as an opportunity to promote greater education on topics of systemic oppression and liberation. By no means do I treat the M4BL trendy or faddy (if that were the case I would not be spending thousands and thousands of dollars on a degree in Africana Studies) but it has definitely been appropriated, as have many aspects of black culture.

I think making a ""unhappy meal"" is a genuinely funny bit of corporate advertising... but its cringy to frame it as some mental health thing.

My fiance ordered a chicken whopper from Burger King. There was a tuft of hair stuck to the cheese.

Fuck off dude, your profile is so fucking useless and unfunny.

But in reality, isn't all just a BIG contradiction? Not point to even point out every single contradiction because that is why a lot of people have issues with them. It falls into the same lines as black people and racism... it's Ok for blacks to be racist and ignorant and violent towards others but when it is done for them #blacklivesmatter #stoptheracism and for the record, I am African American so it's sad hearing that from me. 

&#x200B;

Now it falls into the same category because feminist try to educate or preach and make awareness to things that are 100% false or happened decades ago. I don't understand it because every time I see something dealing with a feminist it is always being disrespectful towards men and acting like they're the victim but if done back to them it proves their point? what is up with this?  

I am not saying all feminists are toxic but what are they trying to accomplish? Women have more rights then men believe it or not (Prove me wrong) They have more job opportunities and just overall if I had to put it into a percentage I'd say woman have it twice as easy than men do but still want more..? why?","“Aren’t you all just wrong” isn’t a great question. Is there something specific in there that you want to talk about?

If you don't approve of being disrespectful or acting like a victim, then why are you doing it all over this post?  

If you think that's an acceptable way to act, then why are you complaining about other people doing it?  

If the problem is ""dishing it out but not taking it"", then aren't you doing the exact same thing by objecting to feminists doing it, when you openly admit that it is also ""done back to them"" and you're doing it yourself in this post?

Do you have any citations for any of the things you claim?

[removed]

 “Aren’t you all just wrong”   isn't what i asked

I'll sum it up? I know my English is bad and my wording is awful but I'll sum it up. 

What is the goal of a feminist? 

Why do they act like a victim?

Why do they act like they have less privilege than men?

Why are they toxic towards men but heavens forbid if it is done back to them?

hm? I'm the most disrespectful person there is?

To be honest, I can care less I'm just trying to figure out what is the point of all the ranting feminist do..? probably isn't a reason but to make crap 1 sided:'D damn just admit it like saying people have freedom of speech but we all know we don't freedom of speech is long gone. Just asking what is a feminist because the crap they do and rant about is contradictive as hell. I mean like keep it real instead of playing the men are a bad woman are saints bull shit... 

Not that i don't approve of being disrespected but as i said before It is ok for whatever women do but the minute a man does it back or whatever stop the press?

You people go off of ignorant opinions instead of facts...

""Aren't you all just wrong"" isn't what you asked, but it's the basis behind your whole question. Your question can easily be summed up that way, and you breaking it down into different flavors of wrongness doesn't change that.

Yes, you have been disrespectful. If you think that's an okay way to behave, then it's hypocritical to complain when other people do it. You're doing *the exact same thing* that you say feminists are doing. 

I think your argument would be a lot stronger if it was more consistent.

> If a girl doesn't want to be sexualized why dress in a way to make people look at you? 

News flash, pal, women are sexualized no matter what they're wearing, and I shouldn't have to cover every part of my body in a shapeless bag in order to be left alone walking down the street.

> not just woman get sexually harassed but men too

""but men, too"" is not a good argument. If something happens to a woman 99 times and to a man once, that doesn't make it ""not a gender thing.""

Just because it’s the norm doesn’t make it okay. Saying that’s just the world we live in is absolutely awful. 
I’m not talking about a girl getting looked at. I’m talking about them being groped and spoken to very inappropriately and that happening several times in one night. Which sadly, isn’t uncommon. Sure it happens to a man on occasion. But know where near as often or to the extent that it happens to women.

The fact you can't even answer the question instead shows me there is no reason/answer Kinda like talking about something that happened 300 years hence just ranting...

The only question I really care to know is what is the point of feminist and what is the goal?

Ok so me pointing out things is disrespectful...? OKAY as i said gonna just leave this alone :'D

I'm asking a forum basically full of people with a 1 sided opinion instead of looking at the overall view... A lot of things you people say are correct but again what country / year are you people referring to? not usa 2019... Maybe usa 1900s Maybe early 2000s probably some 3rd world country but not the  usa...

wait ima just leave this alone lol just dawned on me there is no point to this (Knew that from the start) As stated before No freaking wonder people can't stand sjws and feminist cause they're full of contradictions.. An that isn't even my opinion it's a damn fact You're all saying legit the same thing and again what time/ country are you people are you people in.. 
Wearing booty shorts and having you butt cheeks hanging out
You're legit asking for someone to do something to you..
Dressing not normal meaning would you go to a school dressed that way? would you go to work dressed that way?  Like Wearing a body suite of steaks and going into a lion's den with hungry lions...

If people have a bit of common sense a lot of shit wouldn't happen? like do you people like not see what females do..? But i guess...  I guess...

I know what u meant and that is what I was meaning too and again it goes both ways acting like it only happens to a woman is what is crazy more guys get sexually assaulted than females but it gets taken as a joke? like seriously..? again acting like females have it harder like common now...?

You're legit proving my point of how you people think the crap only happens to women...  Acting like women are the victims and it only happens to them  99% of the time and that is a bs lie common... crazy man lol no wonder feminist have so much hate...

Why bother? You went off like a damn fool without having any idea what you were talking about. You didn't provide anything that backed up any of what you said, you just stated your opinions like they were facts and then called us hypocritical SJWs. It would be a waste of time, and we get enough chuckleheads in here thinking they're gonna disprove feminism or whatever. Your mind is made up AND you're being antagonistic so like

why

protip for the future, though-- if you actually want people to talk to you and answer your questions try not being so combative right off the bat.

I can, I just don’t think it’s worth my time given your demeanor. It doesn’t seem like you’re here to learn, so it’s not worth it to write out a thoughtful answer.

First of all, your little spiel about both feminism and black people fighting against racism didn't make any sense at all. You completely ignore the fact that white people, for most of this country's history, were violent and racist as hell toward black people and still are today. And I seriously question your claim of being black, because it's like you just skipped over that part for some reason---you need to pick a history book. And feminists are still having to fight against blatant sexism and discrimination that is still going on today, as we speak--like the #MeToo movement has shown---not something that happened a hundred years ago. 

Basically, you just came in here slamming both women and black people for even fighting against racism and sexism at all, which is ridiculous and really makes no sense, and make like they're the bad guys, which is stupid and immature as hell on your part. You just showed a complete ignorance of both issues---feminism and racism----and when you got called on it, you stomped off and left. You need to start doing some research on both, and actually learn something about them. You don't come in somewhere claiming you want to learn something, then come in here talking a bunch of ignorant BS about the very people you claim you want to learn from. Next time you bother to come back here, be more respectful and drop the ignorant, arrogant attitude, because you clearly don't know jack about anything.

Come on it's common sense. You don't touch someone without permission. Regardless if what they are wearing. Most dudes make up that stuff in hopes that they'll get away with it. That's a current problem that we are still pushing back against.

I'd suggest reading through hear and different feminist talking points. There's a lot that still happens even in the US.

> more guys get sexually assaulted than females

No they don't.

""Most dudes make up that stuff"" you have the reversed lol you got that waaay reversed why i said what i said when it happens to a male it is either laughed at or not taken serious and u legit just admitted to that... If someone can do something and get away with it they will

And what are you basing this on ""no they don't""? :'D

82% of all juvenile sexual assault victims are female. 90% of adult victims are female.

3% of men have been the victim of a sexual assault in their lifetime.

Like I get vitriol on both sides, but it seems like you want to chuck some gas on this instead of fixing things.

BLM can't regulate the cops.

Fuck. Off.

Did a mean ol'cop confiscate your stash once?

BLM are domestic terrorists.

BLM is active in the state. Have a conversation with your local group if you want to help.

What does this have to do with the Stop & Shop strike?

I beg a differ. Since BLM ""regulated"" few piglets here and there whole justice system changed. Example Tahanks to BLM piglet must wear BodyCams- thats HUGE win against corrupt oinkers

how many lives GENERATIONS millions were ruined thanks to racist reefer policies families fractured still doing sentences ask ur self this kind Sir. Now it's legal so suck on that :)

Cops are domestic terrorists. BLM only killed few bad seeds while piglets so far 300+ ppl this year alone. Most are poor whites or minorities. Previous years were higher up to 3000 ppl per year but thanks to BLM soldiers killing few cops and cops being equipped with BodyCam the killings are less fewer

To millions Americans even Europeans BLM are heroes regulators of national uniform wearing terrorists aka Police

I don't think BLM want anything to do with this one...

sorry I didn't know the WHOLE tread was meant for Stop@Stop strike lol

Did you have a stroke?

Why do you say that?

too young too beautiful to have a stroke kind Person. They still let you use internet at this hour at your convalescent house? That's impressive!

The ""this one"" I'm referring to is captain dipshit OP,  not any of the current cop shootings.

>too young too beautiful to have a stroke kind Person.

Too stupid to put a simple sentence together as well.

Oh, well, yeah, OP doesn't seem like the type that does anything useful for his community anyway.

but sure love to see roasted CT piglets heee heee

It came after hearing the horrible, degrading, vile things he said about women.

It came after hearing him encourage his supporters to be violent with protestors.

It came after he advocated for Muslims to be expelled and profiled.

It came after he made fun of a man with physical disability.

It came after he framed the BlackLivesMatter movement as criminal and subversive.

It came after he personally criticized the appearance and weight and sexual activity of women opponents.

It came after he chose a Vice President who believes gay people can pray away their gayness.

It came after the KKK and the neo-Nazis endorsed him.

These were all things you had to weigh to cast your vote, and by whatever method you used, you declared theses things within your morally acceptable parameters.

I want to believe that you do value equality and diversity and in the inherent value of every person as much as I do. 

I want to believe that people are precious to you, no matter their color or gender or faith tradition or sexual orientation. 

But if you refuse to speak into the events of these days, if you choose to stay silent, whether out of fear or shame or buyer’s remorse or ambivalence—I will have no choice but to believe that you are okay with all of this.

And here’s the thing, friend: If you were to say that you are not okay with all of this, if you were to stand up to the bigots and the racists and the misogynists and the homophobes and the anti-Semites and the xenophobes—you will find that I will stand with you.

I will hold your inaction against you.

I will hold your refusal to see the pain of those your vote has at least in some part, initiated against you.

I will hold your lack of compassion for the marginalized against you.

So yes, I believe you are not the horrible things I am seeing from the hateful, vicious, intolerant few from the fringes, but that belief comes with the expectation that I will hear you now; that you will shout to the fringes that this is not what you meant bymaking America great.

I want to bewieve that you do vawue equawity and divewsity and in the inhewent vawue of evewy pewson as much as I do. 

I want to bewieve that peopwe awe pwecious to you, no mattew theiw cowow ow gendew ow faith twadition ow sexuaw owientation.

And hewe’s the thing, fwiend: If you wewe to say that you awe not okay with aww of this, if you wewe to stand up to the bigots and the wacists and the misogynists and the homophobes and the anti-Semites and the xenophobes—you wiww find that I wiww stand with you.

I pwomise you.

I wiww not howd youw vote against you, because I twust that you awwived at that vote as cawefuwwy, pwayewfuwwy, and sewiouswy as I did mine. 

But make no mistake, I wiww howd youw siwence now against you.

I wiww howd youw inaction against you.

I wiww howd youw wefusaw to see the pain of those youw vote has at weast in some pawt, initiated against you.

I wiww howd youw wack of compassion fow the mawginawized against you.

So yes, I bewieve you awe not the howwibwe things I am seeing fwom the hatefuw, vicious, intowewant few fwom the fwinges, but that bewief comes with the expectation that I wiww heaw you now; that you wiww shout to the fwinges that this is not what you meant bymaking Amewica gweat.

It comes with the expectation that you wiww teww the Pwesident-Ewect and youw ewected officiaws and youw pastows, that these things do not have a pwace in the countwy you desiwe.

It comes with the expectation that you speak now to the mawginawized, and that you weitewate theiw wowth, heaw theiw gwief, vawidate theiw feaw, and that you come to theiw defense in both wowd and in tangibwe suppowt.

Any sources or excerpts would be greatly appreciated also.

The question is ""Explain the emergence of the BlackLivesMatter movement"". Referring to social movement theories and examples.

I'm aware of some old social movement and theories such as 'Strain and Breakdown' and new social movement theories such as Beck (1992) and his discussion of changing power relations, Emotion and social movements.

Any help to link these to the emergence of BLM and other sociological theories you have knowledge of to explain the emergence and additional information on BLM would also be great.

/r/ChapoTrapHouse for entertainment.

/r/COMPLETEANARCHY

r/breadtube for leftist youtube content, and r/paganproles for leftist paganism.

Would /r/ToiletPaperUSA and /r/ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM be a possibility for the Entertainment category?

r/paganproles

/r/LeftistInfighting is a new one - if you want an outlet for your frustrations or bottled up rants against your fellow leftists.

/r/poldersocialisme for Dutch memes about socialism

r/beardtube is a brand new subreddit for spreading new and established leftist content creators on YouTube and revolutionary videos, as well as discussion. All leftists welcome.

r/Redeurope

Maybe r/antiwork too? Lot of socialist thinking, but their primary concern is the push for automation!

for the religious section r/RadicalChristianity

also r/DemocraticSocialism

I'd suggest r/ContraPoints and r/Gamingcirclejerk for entertainment.

r/ani_communism

This is great, it would also be helpful to have a table showing the number of subscribers in each subreddit to get an idea of the most active and ""can't-miss"" subreddits on this list

Also r/dprk

I hate to seem like I'm spamming this thread, but I keep remembering subs after I've posted. There's r/labour for the UK labour party, and r/darkfuturology which I'd say is left adjacent, it's not clearly socialist, but you'll see a lot of socialist crossposts come from there.

there is also /r/canadian_socialism  (far-left)  /r/canadaleft (broad left, more soc-dems but still okay) for canadian leftist subs.

There are several francophone ones too: /r/seddit (broad far-left, rather theory centric) /r/anarchisme (obvious, rather inactive)/r/communedereddit (memes) /r/feminisme (feminist conversations in french. very left leaning) and /r/metaquebec (good memes, rather active, billingual).


Also, note to OP, but putting LGBTQ+ subs such as /r/radicalqueers in ""lifestyle"" alongside vegans and preppers is a bad bad look.

r/JusticeReturned could go in entertainment.

r/Brasildob

r/LibertarianLeft

r/thebakery

r/ClimateJustice

r/ecosocialism

R/capitalismindecay is not the same sub as r/capitalism_in_decay. The first one is a collection of information and explicitly not about memes. The second one is the sub created as the not-socdem alternative to LSC after the coup.

/r/goodpraxis

r/cultural_marxism_irl

Quite a few of these subreddits have been dead for months, I'm not sure what the utility of listing them here is unless you want to bring them back, which is something that hardly ever happens with onilne forums that lose their entire userbase.

/r/LateStageCapitalism and /r/Anarchy101

Hello, (mods remove this if it is not allowed), I am the Party Secretary for the Socialist Party in the Reddit and Discord based sim of the US Government. We recently split from the Democratic Party and have formed a broadtent, Leftist party. We are welcoming of any and all leftist ideologies ranging from communism, libertarian socialism, leftist anarchism, Leninism, marxism, democratic socialism, etc.

We do simmed elections where you win seats based on your amount and quality of engagement in the sim, it is quite fun to be involved in and the community is active and great. We recently gained major party status and are trying to win more seats in the upcoming election.

If you want to read more about us and see what we do, come to our [subreddit] (https://www.reddit.com/r/ModelUSGov/), there you can join the Socialists, if you want too, read more about the sim, and even join the Discord if you just want to see how the community is.

Religion is the opiate of the masses

Also thank you for the list comrade, I found a bunch of places I've just joined because of it.

EnlightenedCentrism is so good

I'd add /r/ABoringDystopia which is a possibly even bleaker LSC, not entirely sure if it's explicitly socialist but the content leans that way.

and /r/ChapoTrapHouse2 for even more entertainment with less soc-dems.

Pretty much the only socialist entertainment sub that's actually entertaining and its not on the list

Another sodem place...

Kwam hier om dit te posten

I second this. Democratic Socialism is Socialism. I hate that Marxist just control the conversation, on what Socialism means.

We're not adding subs of imperialist parties.

Apologies. Changed.

Fuck that brocialist shithole.

r/LSC has been taken over by sodems.

This isn’t the place to relitigate your ban from another sub.

You should check out the rest of that quote!

And more Garfield.

Your list is full of socdem-tolerant subs but you refuse to add Chapo? What a fucking joke.

Yeah it's definitely got too much socdem leaning for me but there's also plenty of socialists too. As well as anti-imperialism, racism, capitalism, etc.

Ironic coming from an imperialist

Huh? I get pushback cos they're socdems, and they're still trying to get rid of the stink of Blairite centrism, but Corbyn is anti-war, and the party has been opposing further military involvement around the world.

Legit curious, what makes them an ""imperialist party"", if there's something I should I know about I'd like to hear it!

Thanks <3

There are posts calling for the abolition of capitalism all the time. What even is a socdem to you? I don't like the sub but come on ffs..

I was so worried it would show up on this list when I saw this.   
Really glad this did not go without notice.

I have no dog in that fight, but at least add /r/Anarchy101.

Seems unlikely since I was just banned from there for speaking out against tankies elsewhere.

I’m not trying to get myself unbanned, just wanted to rant really

Agreed.  Too many edgy atheists quote Marx without reading the broader context of what he was arguing.  

>[The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is the demand for their real happiness. To call on them to give up their illusions about their condition is to call on them to give up a condition that requires illusions. The criticism of religion is, therefore, in embryo, the criticism of that vale of tears of which religion is the halo.] (https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1843/critique-hpr/intro.htm)

He essentially argues that religion serves to alleviate the pains and alienation experienced under capitalism, but also says to abolish religion without seeking to change the conditions that *require* the need for ""illusions"" like it would be cruel.

You can call for the abolition of capital all you like, but as long as you support reformism and imperialism and oppose actual socialist revolutions, you're a socdem and a Rosa murderer. The current mods do exactly that.

According to Marx, it would not only be inhumane but also in vain to try to take away from the people their ""illusionary happiness"" before we've overthrown ""all relations in which man is a debased, enslaved, abandoned, despicable essence"". Marx compares religion with the consumption of opiates insofar as both are a form of of protest and source of consolation. But Marx was materialist and he argued throughout his life that relgion hampers the development of class consciousness. 

We must combat religion but we can't combat it in the same reactionary way as the New Atheists are doing it. As Lenin put it:

>We must combat religion—that is the ABC of all materialism, and consequently of Marxism. But Marxism is not a materialism which has stopped at the ABC. Marxism goes further. It says: We must know how to combat religion, and in order to do so we must explain the source of faith and religion among the masses in a materialist way. The combating of religion cannot be confined to abstract ideological preaching, and it must not be reduced to such preaching. It must be linked up with the concrete practice of the class movement, which aims at eliminating the social roots of religion. 

* Lenin, The Attitude of the Workers’ Party to Religion

Social democracy is capitalism with a welfare state and some nationalist industries, anyone that calls for the abolition of capital is absolutely not one, you are just treating the definition like it is meaningless which makes the whole point without value in turn.

You should oppose a socialist revolution if it becomes perverted and inhumane, e.g. Stalin's Russia or Pol Pot's Cambodia. The idea that one should unconditionally support anything with a red flag that uses the right pretty words is utterly nonsensical.

Reform in itself won't bring about socialism but it will still help the lives of many of the most needy, e.g. if British people vote Labour next general election it will both move the overton window left thus increasing the perceived legitimacy of socialism among the populace and also saving tens of thousands of preventable lives that would be lost through austerity.

No, you shouldn't support socialist revolutions if they're shit revolutions.

Yes, you should support reformism as it will improve the lives of millions, though you should also do other revolutionary work alongside it and not rely on it as your only strategy.

Using these numbers for 2018: https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/national/police-shootings-2018/

Total shot:

White men: 428  
Black men: 219  
White women: 28  
Black women: 10  

Per capita (number shot per 1 million people), using figures from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography_of_the_United_States#Race

Black men: 10.88  
White men: 3.66  
Black women: 0.5  
White women: 0.24

Per capita, black men are about 3 times more likely to be shot than white men, but white men are around 7 times more likely to be shot than black women.

 A black male is still a black life

Blm doesn't just have to do with shootings

That is because males commit a gross amount of crimes compared to females. If cops encounter 30 males to every female for a violent crime of course males are going to be shot more 

[deleted]

Did you also know that despite being just 13% of the population, blacks commit 52% of all violent crime?

Don't commit crimes and police won't shoot at you.

Thought this would be common knowledge.

White males tend to cooperate with the five oh 

A black male is still a male life. If you want a shorter slogan, MaleLivesMatter makes more sense since being male is the more important risk factor.

[deleted]

are u implying that male are inherently more violent?

I literally said being black increases your chances. But being male increases your chances *much more*.

Is that because they just want to commit crime or is it something deeper. You be the judge. 

Did you know of that 13%, it's almost entirely male which brings it down to 6.5%.  And if you factor out babies and old men it brings it down to under 4%.  **So \~4% of people commit 52% all violent crime.** 

If you narrow it down even further. Most violent crime is committed by roughly 7-8% since its primarily the males who do it. 

There's even a video on this:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEvMc-K8XHY

Thing with humor.. is it's how we talk about the truth 

Working with the enemy can keep you alive. 

Not really. White people still commit more crimes in 28/30 felony categories 

Yes. that is exactly what I am implying 

[deleted]

I saw a black guy do a training exercise with the police department, they gave him a toy gun and told a guy to just walk towards him, the black guy told him to stop and he kept walking, he was about 15ft away when the guy opened up on him hahaha. The officer came over like oh shit did you just shoot this guy for walking towards you. The back guy said he felt threatened. Done. 

And it does. Unless you resist and then you might get shot. 

disgusting.

A perfect example of why feminists are twisted people.

That should not be the norm though. The main problems the BLM looks to correct are the inconsistencies of sentencing and treatment of minorities (mainly African Americans) vs whites. It's continuously proven over and over that minorities are sentenced harder for the same crimes as whites. 

Or if you want a visual example take every mass shooter in the US (all white). If they didn't kill themselves they were taken alive with barely a scratch on them (not including the LV shooter obviously) while you have black men who simply run from the police betting killed. Yes they shouldn't run but to shoot them dead is uncalled for period no matter what they did. The more we let cops get away with that the more people they are going to do it to, before they eventually make themselves judge, jury, and executioner. 

/r/thatHappened 

Resistance is futile

Sorry you don't like evidence, biology, and facts? 

Non feminist here! 

 Crime statistics show that we actually are more violent.  

Unless you think males are being unfairly represented, then the numbers don't lie. 

God you are so fucking dumb. He probably isn't even a feminist. What he said is objectively true.

Idiot, we can’t be equal for everything. Men are clearly more violent, just like women are physically weaker. 

When those statistics are trotted out they often fail to mention the fact that repeat offenders are also more likely to be black and repeat offenders also get more jail time.

>The main problems the BLM looks to correct are the inconsistencies of sentencing and treatment of minorities (mainly African Americans) vs whites

Black men only get 9% longer sentences than white men.  That's easily explainable by cultural factors (the vast majority of black fathers do it out of wedlock).  

> Or if you want a visual example take every mass shooter in the US (all white). If they didn't kill themselves they were taken alive with barely a scratch on them (not including the LV shooter obviously)  

Incredibly small sample, and mass shootings have a lot of cops responding to the situation which makes it far easier to neutralize them.

> while you have black men who simply run from the police betting killed. 

Nope.  There are always additional circumstances.  Like pointing objects at the cops after running, or driving in a car full of bullet holes etc.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I’d find the link but I cba.

none of which you presented

the claim was that it was inherit

Crime statistics also show that black men are far, far more violent than white men and based on the numbers alone like you are doing we can say that it is inherit, right?

based on feminist propaganda

I don't need to. It is common sense. 

Testosterone has tons of studies and evidence behind it for being a precursor to violence in men that women don't have. 

This isn't even mentioning that something like 95% of serial killers are males and Males commit a gross 93% of homicides 

Which explains the throwaway. 

According to the FBI crime database of 2017,males commit 87% of all homicide,97% of all rape and 80% of all assault. Is that good enough? 

As in more prone to? 

I want to clarify that I'm basing this on American stats.

I personally feel like all males in general are going to be represented a lot more accurately than black males in America due to profiling. 😬 

TONS OF STUDIES 

Provides none lmao

how is that biological proof?

The 4% or so of america that is black men commit over 50% of all violent crime in the USA.  Profiling black men is far more accurate than profiling men.

So if you are willing to say that men are inherently more violent than women (stats) because of higher testosterone (bio) and societal pressures (sociology) than you have to say that black men are more violent than white men (stats) due to higher testosterone (bio) societal pressures (sociology).

&#x200B;

 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex\_differences\_in\_crime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_differences_in_crime) 

Has about 30 studies rolled into one article for you

 [https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2015/crime-in-the-u.s.-2015/tables/table-42](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2015/crime-in-the-u.s.-2015/tables/table-42) 

Here is also the FBI reporting Data showing Males commit 74% of all crimes. 

This includes the following,

1. 89% of murder and manslaughter
2. 97% of rapes
3. 86% of robberies
4. 79% of Assaults

&#x200B;

The only crimes women are comparable in are embezzlement and prostitution. 

You know you are wrong and you knew you were wrong before this comment, but if you insisted on being handed an L. Here it is. 

&#x200B;

I'm not gonna disagree lol hard to argue numbers. I just wanted to consider the factor of racism here 🤷‍♂️

you said biological? 

These arent studies on biology.

So are you a sexist?  If saying black men are inherently more violent using stats is racist wouldn't saying the same about men vs. women be sexist?  You can't have it both ways.  Either we accept reality, or we go full PC.

Also I didn't say it was racist. I was saying the numbers can be skewed because of it. 

I don't think interpreting data makes you a sexist *or* a racist though. 

Chill out with the insults. Its not my fault ur a feminist

I'm saying that the same data that shows that men are more violent than women, shows that black men are more violent than white men.

You can't take one without the other.

 ItS NoT My fAuLt uR A FeMiNiSt

Nah buddy I'm just not a fucking retard lmao

Get fucking clapped with facts 

I feel like you saw the word racism and jumped on an opportunity to make me contradict myself... 

I'm not choosing one over the other. Never said I was. If the numbers show that black males are more violent than white males then that shows they are. Same with men vs women. 
 
There's no other way to interpret these numbers. I only mentioned racial profiling my have skewed the numbers. 

and if you want my true personal opinion,  I *do* think black Americans are more violent than whites. I felt it was worth mentioning that racial profiling may have fluffed up the numbers. I never said it showed they weren't.  There's no way they were fluffed hard enough to be completely incorrect. 

toxic feminist at it again

My man, you just got your ass cheeks clapped in this argument and are resorting to weak insults because you have no counter argument and got destroyed. 

Move on and learn something from this 

Wow now ad homs from the feminist

Sick zinger bud

Well said mate. The world is accelerating toward complete fuckedness. Everybody is too politically correct and too many people are getting offended by nothing.

It’s ok to be offended at things but accept that if something offends you then it’s your problem.

They tried that in South Africa a while back. It was called apartheid and it didn’t work.

Yeah, for real.  That's just straight segregation

Yeah! You don't force diversity and equality. You let it happen naturally.

Living in the world today is so ass backwards... 1865 we we're segregated by law, and now we are segregating each other by choice. Freedom causes weird outcomes. 

It's a great time to be a brown person.

What kind of initiatives and groups would you promote as healthier alternatives to these, which still work (or work better) to address the problem?

None of these groups are restricted to females, blacks or other groups. They’re just predominantly female, black, etc because they are obviously the victims of racism, sexism and prejudice. There are plenty of male supporters among feminist and women’s rights groups; and white people who support groups against racism (including BLM); thousands of straight people who support LGBT movement. Upvoted because this is indeed an unpopular opinion and with good reason. 

I hate everyone equally so..... That's my approach. 

We need to unite not divise ourselves.

Ah yes, tell those minorities and women how to fix racism and sexism, white man. After all, they're inferior beings and need this knowledge from you, who has a proper appreciation of being affected by prejudice.

These minorities (or a party of ugly fat women, in feminist case) don't want equality. They want revenge. If they ever achieve it, they'll instantly be at each other's throats far worse than nazis and jews. But just imagine all the minorities fighting each other, demanding a person to be fired or falsely accusing each other of rape. The media, politicians and corporations who like to lick these freaks' nutsucks by firing normal white men as soon as demanded to because ""THEY HURT MUH FEELINGZ!!"" will be confused as shit. Imagine a feminist accusing a gay or rape? Don't act on it and you're sexist. ""REEEEE!"" Act and you're homophobic. ""REEEE!!"" It'll be glorious!

I think you are conflating the very small minority that has this ideology. Most people just ask for fairness. The reason why exclusive clubs are there is because they are a victim group and can relate. They come together and are bound by shared experience. People not bring discriminated don't really see the problems other people face. I'm extremely privileged and when I hear some of the ways my friends from discriminated against, it makes my blood boil. 

Ignore the people who are all for extremes. They aren't the  representative sample and it's easy enough to ignore them. 

They're not trying to solve anything, it's a power play.  All social justice is is just a power play from bullies

Just a bunch of dipshitz wildly scratching at their minor inches and turn them into bleeding gashes

Why shouldn't we have the right to segregate ourselves? I dont care to be around white people unless I absolutely have to. Humans desire people who look like them and share their culture.

Yet it’s completely fine when whites separated the blacks. Now we want to moderate how other groups choose to act in reply. 

I’d say it’s better mow than ever before. Never take progress for granted. Black people need to stop acting like victims and start acting like leaders and professionals and stop banging on about slavery- that shit does mot happen any more, i’d say anybody who was enslaved is probably dead now.

Getting rid of these sjws and their racist/sexist clubs is the solution.  They make up the vast majority of racism and sexism in the whole damn western world.  They are the problem they claim to oppose.

Those aren't the groups I'm directly referring to. I'm talking about the ones that discriminate

A whole paragraph, and not one true word in it.

You can disagree with someone without being a racist.

Thanks for throwing up the flag and telling us all how sexist and racist you are!

These incels (or a party of ugly fat white men) only want to complain and write fan fiction so they can fantasize about non sense, like the stuff written in this post

They are not a victim group, they are a group brought together by their own racism and sexism.

Oh, so your racist.  Thanks for clearing that up.  I'll be sure to treat you accordingly in the future.

See, the issue here is if a white person said ""I dont care to be around black/brown/whatever group of people unless I absolutely have to"" they will be labeled as a racist. I personally don't care if people decide to separate into groups as they please, but the double standard that arises is a problem.

No you fucking dolt, it's not. How dense do you have to be to think because separation in the past existed that it somehow grants you anything? Especially when you probably didn't live through that time.

And let me be clear on this: if separation back then was a terrible thing by definition, why would anyone bring that back? What reason could you present to justify something pretty much anyone deeply rejects? Opression from a time you neither experienced nor live in? Revenge for the sake of it? 
This is not a discussion talking about how you shouldn't react. This is about the need to spell it out for brickheads like you that separation is racism in the finest form, no matter who instigates it. 

And white people need to stop with the victim complex, not everything is about them.

Except for when white police officers shoot them in the streets like cattle 

Such a convincing, fact-based response 

I see you like to deny reality, might I suggest a few other, less evil religions for you to follow instead of feminism?

* Buddism
* Shinto
* Christianity
* Satanism
* Islam

You are essentially taking what a very small but vocal minority to be there voice of said affected group. 

Thats just my unpopular opinion.

Probably because the only idea was white back then. Now you can’t accept when your white opinions aren’t given any attention so you just snap at people for not counting you in. Not considering your opinion oh gosh you’re the real one acting oppressed because someone doesn’t want to hear your opinion on the matter

Do white people have more of a victim complex than black people? 

Except for the fact that more than half of the people killed by cops are white.

Have you seen the posts here?

Which is way too few when you consider black people are only about 15 percent of the population. 

Edit spelling

Except for the fact that black people get shot at a _higher rate_.

I’ve seen them but much of it is opinion and speculation so I don’t know. I don’t think it’s a race thing more of a ‘everybody is a winey wee bitch nowadays’ thing.

Fuckin get over it and get on with it.

Explain this in a proper sentence. 

“Black people aren’t only about 15 percent of the population”

And you condone white people getting shot but not black? So you are a racist then? 

Holy shit, shocked to learn it was just 16%. Thought the number was much higher, or at least in the 20s

its almost as if they commit violent crime at a higher rate. 

They commit violent crimes at a MUCH higher rate though.

Black men make up 4% of the population but commit almost 50% of the murders.

Now comes the part where you make the excuse that blacks are poor, then I tell you there are more whites living in poverty than blacks, next you'll just resort to calling me a racist for stating all these HateFacts.

Sorry, should be are about 15 percent. Meaning if they are getting shot half the time, there's something absolutely fishy going on.

violent crimes like selling someone a cigarette, wearing a hoodie, running away, driving a car, holding a cell phone...?

Except less than 5% of blacks commit any crime. Whites commit most of the violent crime anyway. 

And before you say it, my number crunching is just as valid as yours. That's the beauty of math.

Does that mean that they're _not_ shot at a higher rate? Is anything I said false?

Honestly I'm interested if it's not socio economic conditions and such that causes black people to commit more murders why do you think they do it?  Is it the warrior gene?

FBI crime stats. Look it up. 6 percent of the population commits half the murders. 

Yep, DNA is the only real explanation that makes sense. Lower average IQ all over the globe. Africans are the only race with no neanderthal DNA.

It's definitely not Whitey's fault.

black people and white people are equally likely to smoke weed, but one group is 3x more likely to be arrested, guess which one

Now i'm no caveman expert but were neanderthals not the dumb ones?  Wouldn't having no neanderthal dna make you smarter?

Jim Crow

The ones that live in high violent crime areas? The ones that aren't as low key when the commit crimes perhaps? The ones that give cops a reason to draw their attention towards at higher rates? 

If blacks had the violent crime rates of Asians no one would be fucking with them for the most part. 

That's a myth, they actually had larger brains than humans, used tools and had their own language. They just got outbred by the dumber species, kinda like what is happening now.

https://www.inverse.com/article/12945-neanderthals-went-extinct-because-they-were-smart-sad-and-alone-just-like-you

I mean dolphins have larger brains than humans I wouldn't say they're more intelligent.  The neanderthals being outbred are just a theory, there are other theories like their immune systems weren't as good, they didn't adapt their hunting methods properly, there could have been conflicts between them and homo sapiens (perhaps those nasty black ones with their warrior genes), etc but at the end of the day the reasons why neanderthals went extinct are pretty debated and it's bold of you to make an assumption into why they went extinct and then to make an even further assumption that they were undoubtedly smarter than humans.

Know how we rebelled against England and now we're not English anymore? That's because history affects the present. Today doesn't exist in a vaccum away from the past.

Cause and effect is real.

I’m 23 turning 24 next month and I hate when a black person my age pulls the race card and says “I was a slave!” Like fuck no you weren’t 

Racism is not as bad as it used to be, but it still exists systemically speaking. Just because the civil rights act was passed in 1964 doesn’t mean that racism is over as we know it. The police are still targeting black neighborhoods and black people are more likely to be pulled over by a cop than white people.

Um, the native Americans have nearly been wiped out. So no you don't hear them throw fits. Cops plus the prison system is trying to wipe out blacks so yes they throw fits. America is a joke. Cops can shoot blacks with no punishments. Yes racism in America is a joke.

You have a commendable attitude that is unfortunately a bit detached from reality. The problem is that institutional and societal racism is still prevalent in American society even today and continues to affect minorities in a negative manner. That is why the conversation around it is still relevant.

[deleted]

Did I actually just read you say yesteryear?

People act like the judges and politicians that opposed the civil Rights act like disappeared as soon as it was passed,or that the very large populations of white Americans that opposed it stopped being racist. Like these people were, and are still in power. They had kids. and politics is very nepotistic. If their kids didn't go into politics they most likely went into law. 

AIM would like to disagree with you.. not to mention Wounded Knee 1973 and the yearly Dakota Ride, plus the Idle No More protests (like the one I was part of at the Mall of America in 2012.. by accident).


And of course the DAPL protests a couple years ago.

Racism does go both ways. Unfortunately, you appear to be stuck on petty bullshit instead of the causes of social issues which yea, does make you look like a racist advocating for faux equality on your own terms.

Allivesmatter was an almost all white movement and knee jerk reaction to black people claiming their lives matter. Definitely not a shining example of racism in this country at all.




Sure did, pretty common word in the South East United States.

Don't hear it often?

You're clearly a racist so there's no point. You probably wish you were the guy pulling the trigger in New Zealand lol

Not sure what to make of that but okay.

Ok I just read the whole argument of you two, and while I agree with some points you both made, calling him the New Zeland shooter is both racist and poorly worded.

I don't think either of you is right.

[deleted]

If you think 5 million is a lot of a race of people that used to own the Americas then you're hugely mistaken. Here's some. They say there was 112 million natives before Columbus came. Small pox alone killed 8 million. So your 5 million number...lol yes, they have nearly been wiped out. Goddamn you're dumb. White power amiright.

History matters. What's wrong with you. Haven't you heard of history repeating itself? I personally don't want the black population to dwindle down to 5 million... Do you?

Your username and all your post being about “OG” fortnite skins…

Bangalores speed boosting ability ""double time"" is a military term that has been used for decades. It has to do with her being a soldier, not being black. 

""Noun

double time (uncountable)

(military) A fast marching pace of 180 steps per minute, 36 inches in length for the Marine Corps and Navy, 30 inches in length for the Army. It is not really double the speed of quick time as quick time is 112-120 steps per minute""

I am all for equality of representation, but this post is an insult to the injustice and intolerance black people, and people of color have endured for countless years. There are literal hate crimes being committed out in the world, and legit discrimination, but you want to make a video game character an issue? She ""double times"" it because she's a soldier, not because she's black. She covers the field with smoke to gain tactical advantage, just like soldiers and S.W.A.T do. 

Get outta here with your false flag bullshit 

humm what is the skin color of lifeline i cant remember

Considering that you quoted Aberjhani and plastered ninjas actual name on it within the first 4 lines, this is definitely a b8. Quality one for sure, but a bait nonetheless

2 is not enough. And it’s not only that, it’s the fact that Respawn is being flat out racist to African Americans with their Bangalore character

I hope it does. I feel that this is a big issue in the esports community right now

because I think it’s important for all Apex Legends players to be aware of this situation

is that a skin?

they shouldn’t

no

I know you are but what am I 

they don’t like me there

the only thing the world owes me is the skull trooper skin on fortnite. i’ve been playing since season 1, (and I can prove it if you don’t believe me) and didn’t buy any OG skins when they first came around simply because I didn’t have enough money. I feel that Epic Games should have taken note of this and given every OG player at least one rare skin but I guess they don’t care for their community

what does that have to do with anything. I like both games and i’m an OG fortnite player with over 150 solo wins, 200 duo wins and a little over 300 squad wins

Maybe the name of her ability relates to a military term but the fact that she runs the fastest while *under fire* is honestly disgusting. I think we all know that this is a direct reference to the stereotype that African Americans are physically “faster” than other races, and the fact that this is in such a popular game today makes me sick. 

I also believe that the “under fire” aspect is a subtle reference to police brutality since many African Americans are harassed by white police officers daily. The whole situation is a huge mess and i’m really surprised as to why others aren’t putting up a fight about it like I am. This is not an issue to be looked over. This is real life

you tell me

don’t say the r word

i’m probably faster

thank you?

I couldn’t agree more. It’s really a shame that racism is still prevalent in our society.

Which do you prefer Red or Blue paint chips? Do you just scramble them all up like a pack of Starburst. ?

Only a pimpled face ""white kid"" think this shit funny tbr.

Mhm k

I wonder why

So you totally ignore lifeline, think epic games owes you anything for playing THEIR game that THEY made and constantly update with new events and skins for its player base that you say they don’t care about. And Bangalore and life line are two of the most commonly played hero’s from my experience there is usually one of the two on every team. In a team shooter her smoke is incredibly useful especially if paired with a bloodhound or a digital threat scope, and the buff to speed when being shot at is incredibly useful for getting to better cover or closing distance. Would you rather them make characters that didn’t have useful abilities or than would you be crying that they made black characters but gave them bad abilities therefor they must hate black people. Or did you just leave out lifeline because you couldn’t twist a black support healing character into it somehow being racist. 

The game is already free . I dont know how much more they can do for you in your bubble. Cool story though.

this is actually pretty shameful on Eic’s part and I hope Respawn and the Apex community will do there part into rectefying that insult from Epic Games

But can you smoke out a room on command? 

what id prefer, is for you to fuck right off and go tell your paint chip jokes elsewhere. as you can tell by your last comment everyone seemed to enjoy them.

what about this is funny? i’m trying to spread a message to the gaming community as a whole

You wrote that yourself? wow congrats dude, really, that's very cool. i just told everyone in my family about it, everybody thinks that's very impressive and asked me to congratulate you. they want to speak to you in person, if possible, to give you their regards. they also said they will tell our distant relatives in christmas supper and in NYE they will ignite fireworks that spell your name. i also told about this enormous deed to closer relatives, they had the same reaction. they asked for your address so they can send congratulatory cards and messages. my friends didn't believe me when i told them i knew the author of this gigantic feat, really, they were dumbstruck, they said they will make your name echo through years and years to come. when my neighbour found out about what you did, he was completely dumbstruck too, he wanted to know who you are and he asked (if you have the time, of course) if you could stop by to receive gifts, congratulations and handshakes. with the spreading of the news, a powerful businessman of the area decided to hire you as the CEO of his company because of this tremendous feat and at the same time an important international shareholder wants to sponsor you to give speeches and teach everybody how to do as you did so the world becomes a better place. you have become famous not only here but also everywhere, everybody knows who you are. the news spread really fast and mayors of all cities are setting up porticos, ballons, colossal boom speakers, anything that can make your name stand out more and see which city can congratulate you the hardest for this magnificent feat.

But it's hard to forget that stuff like this was born out of bullshit microaggression fad outrage like ""man spreading."" And that the people who perpetuated the advancement of stuff like that are some of the stronger voices in #MeToo, and #BlackLivesMatter.

And now with the #CollegeCheatingScandal, I anticipate they'll be there too. To which I say, I dream of a time where those reactive people can be drummed out.

People like that don't add anything to conversation. They're like fire. All it does is destroy indiscriminately. They see a target, stick with it, and aim. No nuance. No devil's advocate. Just echo chambers and condemnation.

I don't want Western society go to back to what it was. The truth buried underneath false pleasantries and keeping up good appearances. Lying in order to present a more digestible reality.

What I want pure and simple, is for Western society to heal. We're supposed to be the more progressive side of the world that people look up to apparently, and we can't even handle basic discourse with people  we disagree with?

Everything's always ""fuck you,"" ""fuck him,"" ""fuck them."" And you know what you're entitled to that. But if you're not willing to peel back layers behind why you feel that way and why they feel that way, well you're just perpetuating the cycle. And you have a front row seat to watch it burn.

This is the time to actually stand up and really be able to say ""things are different"" now. Be able to make things count. Our parents and grandparents thought they were on to something 30 years ago. But they only had a Band-Aid.

All this to say, we need people to fight the right fights.  I'd like to be one of those people to fight the right fight. I'm probably not, but I'd be mad at myself for not ever voicing this out loud. Even if no one cares.",

Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.

Skeletons are scary and spooky, but you know what else is? Blacks. According to the U.S Justice Department, in 2006, 32,443 women of Caucasian origin were raped by men of African origin.

That same year, the number of African American women raped by Caucasian men... was... zero.

In fact, 90% of all interracial crimes in the U.S. are committed by blacks... against whites... So what if all blacks were to... suddenly... disappear from the U.S.?

Murder would go down 49.7 percent, welfare recipients would go down 40 percent, SAT scores would go up about 100 points, the average IQ would go up 7 points, and AIDS victims would go down a staggering... 67... percent.

Significant changes for race that only makes up 13% of the population.

In biology, races are distinct genetically divergent populations ‘’within the same species’’, with relatively small morphological and genetic... differences.

Populations can be described as ecological races if they arise from adaptation to different local habitats or geographic races when they are geographically isolated.

However, if sufficiently different, two or more races can be identified as... sub... species.

So how long do two races have to be isolated from one another before they're considered separate species?

Earlier this year, Archaeologists found artefacts in a cave on Western Australia’s Barrow Island dating back more than 50,000 years, making it Australia’s earliest known site of human occupation.

In contrast, the domestication of the dog began just 15,000... years... ago.

This distance, some several thousand miles between the mainlands of Australia and Asia also caused another kind of distance.

Genetic... distance.

Genetic distance is a measure of the genetic divergence between species or between populations within a species.

Dogs and wolves have been found to have a shorter genetic distance between each other than Negroids and non-Negroids. The distance between Eurasians and Africans being even larger than Homo Sapiens and Homo... Erectus.

Well, it kinda makes sense. I mean, can two races with diverging skin tones, eye colors, behavioral patterns, intellectual and athletic capabilities even be considered the same subspecies? Is it even a question? Is it even a question you're... allowed to... ask?

In October 2007, geneticist James Watson, best known as one of the co-discoverers of the structure of DNA, and the familiar double-helix model we all had to learn in High School, was lambasted by the scientific community for a response he gave in an interview regarding the divergence of intellect between geographically isolated populations.

""There is no firm reason to anticipate that the intellectual capacities of peoples geographically separated in their evolution should prove to have evolved identically,"" James wrote. ""Our wanting to reserve equal powers of reason as some universal heritage of humanity will not be enough to make it so"".

The response resulted with a suspension of Watson's administrative responsibilities and was forced to... cancel... his book tour. And tragically, in 2014, Mr Watson auctioned his Nobel Prize medal he won in 1962, stating that ""no-one really wants to admit I exist"".

Harsh. But people tend to react this way to ideas that go against their own personal world view and... cognitive... biases.

Confirmation bias. It's the tendency to search for, interpret, focus on and remember information in a way that confirms one's... own... preconceptions. This effect, stronger for emotionally charged issues, warps your interpretation of data in a way that keeps you from... being... wrong. There is something fundamental in our minds that makes us hesitant to question ideas that we've... already come to a conclusion to.

We all do it. But who could blame us? That's just part of being a member of the human... species.

And as always, around blacks, never relax.

Haha

This is fiction.

Hey, VSauce, Micheal Here!

The FitnessGram™ Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. \[beep\] A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. \[ding\] Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, start.

[Here is an image I captured of the page](https://i.imgur.com/6XxXTuH.jpg).

>KNOXVILLE, Tennessee — A screengrab of a Snapchat photo circulating on social media Thursday shows what's believed to be four University of Tennessee students, two of whom are wearing blackface, according to a release the university sent to students. 

>UT Knoxville issued a statement to students condemning the behavior. 

>""Earlier today, the university was made aware of a screengrab of a Snapchat photo that included four individuals we believe to be our students. Two of them were in blackface,"" the statement said. ""The image is repulsive and the caption abhorrent.""

>The caption on the photo shared on Twitter read: ""We for racial equality boys. Bout to get this free college now that I'm black let's gooooo #blacklivesmatter"". 

>""The racism displayed in this image does not represent the behavior we expect of students or our Volunteer values. The BIAS Education Response Team—in collaboration with the Office of the Dean of Students—has been made aware of the situation and the university is determining how to handle this incident,"" the note from UTK said.

>According to the university, federal law prohibits the university from sharing how the university handles matters with individual students.

>The University of Tennessee, Knoxville Chapter of NAACP issued the following response Thursday afternoon:

>""To the University of Tennessee, Knoxville Community,

>The University of Tennessee, Knoxville Chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) would like to formally express its strong condemnation to the series of racial attacks that have happened in the last few months, and the most recent form of black face appearing on social media platforms. 

>Here is what we currently know about the incident:

>* An image was originally published on snapchat with four white students, two pictured in blackface, with a statement that read: ""We for racial equality boys. Bout to get this free college now that I'm black let's gooooo #blacklivesmatter""

>Despite ongoing efforts within our university to enhance educational opportunities consisting of culture competency for staff and students regarding diversity, there is clearly more work to be done and we are not on the right track - we cannot, and will not, stand by to watch these situations continuously occur on our campus. 

>We are calling on all students, faculty, and staff to be present at 5:00pm at the Office of Multicultural Student Life located in the Frieson Black Cultural Center to voice their collective concerns following the incident and actionable items that we can take as members of the Volunteer community at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. 

>The University of Tennessee, Knoxville Chapter of NAACP will continue to contribute to the movement of unifying, empowering, and uplifting the black and marginalized communities, as well as holding those accountable for following to ensure a true intrinsic academic experience. 

>We highly encourage that you contact our NAACP chapter president Mustafa Ali-Smith at [REDACTED BUT IN THE ARTICLE] or our Vice President at lms [REDATCTED BUT IN THE ARTICLE] if you have any questions or advice.""

>The Office of Multicultural Student Life said it's hosting an event Thursday, Feb. 28 at 5 p.m. called ""Pain Is Brave: A space for reflection and conversation"". It's set to happen at the Frieson Black Cultural Center Multipurpose Room. It said it's open to the campus community.

>One student who said she was in the photo, who wasn't wearing blackface, reached out to the student who posted the image on Twitter to explain her side of the incident. The student who posted the tweet shared a screengrab of the direct message on Twitter from @chy042400.

>It read: ""Hey, I saw the post you made abt the racist Snapchat post, and I would just want to say that I wasn't aware the guy in who made the post made a racist comment with it. I'm also in the photo and I just want to apologize, I respect struggle and I didn't grow up with much either so him making those comments is ridiculous. I literally thought he was just taking a picture of his face mask. Again I'm really sorry. and I'm trying to contact anyone who was offended so I can apologize.""

>This is a developing story. 10News will continue to update this article as more information becomes available.","Governor of Virginia did it. No consequences. Sarah Silverman did it. No consequences. Kümmel did it. Multiple times. No consequences. Like for like. 

Free speech and all, but I just gotta use mine to say that the guy who wrote the caption here was being a bit racist. Sucks that other people are on trouble for it if they didn't know he was gonna write that.

Racist? Maybe a bit. I think it’s just an off color way of pointing out the racist affirmative action system. 

Definitely comes across as at least a bit racist, but they'd be labeled racist anyways for trying to make the point they're seeming to make about the affirmative action system.

Maybe it has always been this corrupt and racist; or maybe social media has just been exposing it more lately. 
Growing up Asian in NY I grew up with a lot of racism, and I was never taken seriously and always second guessed. 

However, it is probably nothing compared to being Black in America.

I can relate to how you feel. I was born in America but I fled the country when Trump stole the Presidency. The US has changed so much, it's that all of the evil within the country has been exposed.

&#x200B;

1. \#BlackLivesMatter and Ferguson incident: In 3:24, he has the comment ""Not wanting to be killed by police is extremist"". That seemed to be implying that Michael Brown was a victim of police brutality, when in reality, he was a criminal who tried to take a gun from a police officer after being arrested for stealing cigarillos, as these two Washington Post articles explain: [Here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/03/16/lesson-learned-from-the-shooting-of-michael-brown/?utm_term=.e3cf2b695a9f) and [here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2017/03/16/standing-by-my-opinion-that-hands-up-dont-shoot-was-built-on-a-lie/?utm_term=.e195675440a9).             [Also, the Ferguson protestors were looting, burning, and assaulting people in an attempt to get the officer charged](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-30190224), which can be extremist, as [oxforddictionaries.com explains](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/extremist).
2. Patreon Banning: From 9:31 through 9:40, Dan said that someone was banned for using ""racist"" and ""homophobic"" slurs. He was referring to Sargon of Akkad. However, he was banned for the wrong reasons as he was taken out of context. He used ""racial"" slurs towards an some alt-righters in a debate with them. Also, the banning occurred 1 YEAR after the video. If you are going have rules, don't enforce them 1 year late.
3. JihadWatch: Starting in 15:37, Dan talks about how the far-right mass murderer Anders Behring Breivik cited a lot from a blog called JihadWatch, thus Patreon won't work with JihadWatch. Well, the founder of that blog, Robert Spencer, [has specifically stated that he does not condone violence against anyone and that Breivik radicalized WAY before the blog was even started.](https://www.jihadwatch.org/rebuttals)","no. 

No about #1? I am curious.

I agree and understand what you have written, but in the heat of the moment, as a cop, this big black kid who is all ""Yo yo yo"" and comes rushing at you, and tries to grab your gun, you have no choice. And I don't doubt for a moment that Brown was a POS. And I don't REALLY doubt for more than a few seconds that Wilson was a POS as well. And I'm pleased that Colin K did what he did. He is being treated like shit here. Black people have been treated like crap forever, I get it. but doesn't excuse the fact Brown was a POS.

In my opinion the inciting incident doesn’t really matter. If the Black population hadn’t been treated like shit for years prior there probably wouldn’t have been any rioting. A lot of the people at the center of these events aren’t good and lines do get grey. But at that point your so angry and done with the local government and world your stuck in you don’t really care. It’s kinda why black people living in LA were convinced OJ was innocent. They could all probably name a friend or a relative to got fucked over by the police and assumed it was also happening to him even though he 100% did it.

There are a lot of games that just dont have a certain minority in then because nobody actually cares about the race of the character they play as except maybe if its a custom character.

10/10 shitpost

\+1 for top tier shitposting I had a good chuckle.

I’m appalled at how this isn’t being taken more seriously.

You've got to be fucking kidding. 

Thank you, somebody had to say this

Finally. This is a serious issue that I am thrilled to see is gaining attention. 

#ON JAH FAX NO PRINTER

Is this serious

The smoke thing seems like a reach, and the sprinting ability is just a tactical ability man, and is lifeline not black? Also have no idea what color bloodhound is.  Honestly there are 2 whites, 2 blacks, bloodhound? Idk what mirage is but he doesn’t look white, and Gibraltar is clearly an islander. 

Serious question, how do you know Bangalore is an African-American? Is it by her accent? Just curious because I’ve read her bio on EA and don’t see anywhere that she’s African American. 

She could be African-Canadian or from a host of many other countries. 

Also, what about Lifeline? How do we know if she’s not African-American? 

Seriously, if I’m missing something, please let me know. 

I would just hate to see profiling on a post against profiling. 

No I am not. This is a despicable act and I hope legal action will take place. 

Also, why is the ability only for “running away”? Having a much faster base speed is excellent in CQC.

Because I have eyes

My 3 year old has a better grasp on reality than you do apparently. Find yourself a nice corner to cry in. Better yet, dont play the game since its so offensive. 

What are your eyes showing you that says Bangalore is American but Lifeline isn’t. 

Also, what about Bloodhound. 
How do you know what his nationality or race is?

Exactly what they want you to think. Open your eyes sir. 

Because she’s black

But being black doesn’t make her an American. Just like being black doesn’t preclude Bangalore or Lifeline from being American or from any other nationality. 

Open your eyes

Examples include making riffs about BlackLivesMatter and NotAllMen, and Bobo calling himself a ""useful moron"" in Cry Wilderness. I know people in the entertainment industry tend to lean FAR left, and Felicia Day and Patton Oswalt, who are both outspoken liberals, are on the show, but it kind of concerns me. I don't want to hear about politics when I watch MST3K. I want to watch a guy and his robot friends make fun of a shitty movie. ","It's just a show, you should really just relax. 

When did MST3K not have political jokes?

There are no more political jokes on the new show than the old. Remove stick and enjoy.

This post makes me tired.

Why, there's nothing funny about politics! 

https://youtu.be/1jdnwmWm31c?t=457

Joel: Hey, its Donald Trump. He's chasing the good guys away, that doesn't make sense!

JWeinstein's Servo: Come on, it makes **perfect** sense!

Mind you this was in 1989...

The original run didn't shy away from making political cracks, and considering how politically screwed-up America is right now, I don't see how the new show could completely ignore what's happening in the real world right now, especially if something stupid in a movie *does* strike the guys as resembling or sounding like something from today's political landscape.

MMMMM, I agree. TV franchises like MST3K and Star Wars etc should be completely objective without idealogy so people from all paths, like the political right and left, can all come together in the theater and laugh at B-movies. 

[deleted]

This was kind of inevitable since it’s produced in Hollywood now.

It doesn’t have that sleepy cynical midwestern perspective. 

Exactly. The old run had a *ton* of jabs at Reagan and Clinton, not to mention at other contemporary political figures who are perhaps lesser known now (John Sununu, Strom Thurmond, Madeleine Albright, Bob Packwood, Warren Christopher, Trent Lott, Brian Mulroney, etc.), and various world events of the era (“Free Mumia”/Bobby Seale, “Star Wars”, German reunification, the Basque separatist movement, the Quebec separatist movement, etc.). *Boggy Creek II* (which is set in Arkansas) in particular has loads of Whitewater and Ken Starr references.

Perhaps a lot of these references sail over the heads of younger viewers now who might not remember what made the news in the ‘80s and ‘90s, but trust me. There was always a lot of fun to be had at the expense of politics.

Wow this just described my feelings entirely, thank you

That wasn't really *political* back then.  Pretty funny, though.  Especially in hindsight.

>The current run is a calculated attempt to revivify a concept somebody else made popular

By which you mean the same person. You're criticizing present Joel for not being enough like past Joel, which I don't think is fair. He's not a mascot being paraded around by cynical Hollywood producers, he organized the Kickstarter himself and rebuilt the entire production from the ground up. He cast everyone, chose the movies, had final say on the sets and arranged for the big guest stars. This is all him. The hobbyist you praised then is the same one sailing the ship now.

Personally, I don't think either of the two current seasons have done anything nearly as mean as the way they dogged Joe Don Baker back in the day. And I'd hardly call their barbs at Packwood ""gentle"" - nor did they need to be. Or hell, in Radar Secret Service: ""Whoa, I almost ran over Kissinger! I'll have to go back."" Yeah it's just a fun throwaway gag, but try telling that to someone who likes Kissinger (uh...if they exist). That's the thing - the modern divisive climate makes stuff that people used to shrug off sound meaner than it used to. We've color coded every little thing Red and Blue to the point that every political joke now pisses off people who have no reason to get pissed off. The tenor of the jokes hasn't changed, the world has.

And that's fine, but let's keep the right perspective when we recognize it, rather than immediately reaching for the cynical assumption. These are not bean counters producing this. Even on Netflix the show is still made for the same niche audience - perhaps more niche than Netflix would like given that season renewals are like pulling teeth (even this sub has an *order of magnitude* fewer subscribers than the Stranger Things sub). The fact is, this show struggled to get noticed for its entire run in the 90s, and its revival is no different, with only the added benefit that it's easier to find that subset of dedicated fans now.

It's not that I don't think the show hasn't changed, but it hasn't changed *much*.

>Brian Mulroney, etc.

After reading that line all I heard in my head was Mike saying ""Free picture of Brian Mulroney with fill-up.""

I forget which episode it was now off-hand, but I was watching one recently and was surprised to hear a reference to Ruth Bader Ginsberg, way before she was hip.

The best prescience was with the last crack in *Angels' Revenge* with Servo and Crow about Bruce Jenner. 

Yeah, she got a name-check towards the end of *Time Chasers* (along with Nipsey Russell and Chesty Morgan), right after Nick says to Robertson, “we’re all connected, you fool!”

By Curtis Min

 It’s no wonder all writers suffer from self-doubt because everyone knows how hard it is to write. In college, where they forced you to write, what did you do? You plagiarized, you outsourced, or if you were like me said fuck it, smoked some weed and went back to sleep. (Hard to believe I didn’t graduate, right?)

 So everyone knows writing is really hard. But *not* everyone realizes that *choosing* to write is really scary. You’re baring your soul to people because you want to entertain, instruct, or inspire, and most of the time they’re going to tell you that you fucking suck!  Stephen King got rejected something like 30 times before his first novel sold. J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter got rejected by twelve different publishers. Harry Fucking Potter! So if these literary giants, these gods of the word processor got shot down, what chance does a normal person like me have?

 I don’t know if you can really understand how awful this is. Like, can you imagine taking off your clothes for the first time in front of someone you really care about and *knowing* they’re going to laugh at you? Well I’m an Asian man so I know exactly how that feels. But the average person probably doesn’t understand that feeling. I’m sure the average black man reading this is completely fucking baffled. Like when he tries to imagine celebrating Father’s Day. So what I’m saying is that almost every untested author, if he or she is being realistic, should have the insecurity of being an Asian man. It’s a lot of pressure and it discourages people from being creative. 

 The ancient greeks had a much better system. They believed creativity was channeled *through* people, by spirits or some shit. These spirits had a name. Muse. If you wrote something amazing, like an epic poem, an amazing play, or that very first porn scene where a guy stuck his dick through a hole in a pizza box, you still got all the praise, but people also gave your muse credit. (Hey, it’s a really popular trope. Look it up. As if you haven’t already. Perv.) On the other hand if you wrote something really dumb, like that very first scene in a porn where a guy stuck his dick through a hole in a pizza box, it wasn’t entirely your fault. Your muse just happened to shit the bed that time. (Hey, what can I say? It works for both examples. Maybe guys sticking their dicks through holes in pizza boxes is a lot more complicated than we all thought.)

 Anyway, isn’t that a much better system? It really takes the pressure off! Like when I told that Father’s Day joke just now it was because my *muse* is a racist piece of shit, not me! (#BlackLivesMatter!)

 So I decided I would try to find my muse. It’s not as crazy as it sounds. People believed in that stuff for thousands of years. Religious people today believe in all sorts of nutty shit. If you don’t dunk a baby in lukewarm, bacteria infested water, it burns for eternity, right? And if you do it gets three wishes, or something? Anyway, I figured if I had faith, maybe my muse would be real. 

 So I started doing religious shit. No, for real. I fasted, I meditated, I searched for some being, some kind of energy, to give me the courage and inspiration to create. And finally one day while I was meditating I had a vision. 

 She was difficult to describe, but she seemed like an old Asian woman. Her face was wizened, her hair was grey, she was stooped over. But what really struck me was the aura of kindness and wisdom that seemed to emanate from her. 

 At first I just sat with her, trying to take it all in. I’d never had a spiritual experience before and it was overwhelming. I don’t know how long it was because time seemed to be moving differently. Maybe a minute, maybe an hour? But finally I felt ready to speak. She was small, but I could sense her power. I looked down at her, and I asked in my most respectful tone, “Are you my muse?”

 She looked up at me kindly, nodded, and said, in a clear voice, “ME LOVE YOU LONG TIME?”

 Okay sorry, I made that up. You should have known that since no old Asian woman can pronounce the letter L. I would have said ‘RUV’ if that had happened. What she *actually* said was, “Yes I am.”

 “Will you help  me create?” I asked.

 “Yes,” she said. “I teach you everything you need.”

 “I want to make people laugh,” I said. 

 “There is just one secret you need for that,” she said. “Very ancient, very powerful. I teach you, if you think you ready.”

 I was breathing hard and my mouth was dry. I leaned down closer to her. 

 “I’m ready,” I said. “Please teach me.”

 She looked up at me, opened her mouth, and very slowly but clearly said three words.

 “Tell. Better. Jokes.”

 “Fuck,” I said, “are you kidding me? I already knew that. What is this, what kind of muse are you?”

 Her smile collapsed. She looked down at her feet. Shit, I thought. Did I actually hurt her feelings? I felt horrible.

 Suddenly she looked up at me, her eyes suddenly bright again.

 “You write story where man stick dick through hole in pizza box?!” she asked. 

 I opened my eyes, came out of my meditation, and went to go find some weed. 

The end. ","Hey buddy, thanks for submitting. Sorry people are downvoting without providing constructive critique. I wish they wouldn't do that but reddit gonna reddit. 

Two things: 

1. I think this could use boiling down a lot. 
2. I think you have a better chance of being read if you don't write in a memoir style. 

In the first three paragraphs you spend a lot of words not saying a whole lot. At the end of graf 3 you briefly touch on the insecurity of asian men and I think there's a lot of potential for humor there, but it's massively watered down in a sea of not-quite-jokes on the subject of ""woe is me, the tortured writer.""

I think you are definitely on the right track and totally have what it takes to write a great hilarious essay, but I think you're selling your own potential short by allowing your writing to be extremely fluffy. 

> It’s no wonder all writers suffer from self-doubt because everyone knows how hard it is to write. In college, where they forced you to write, what did you do? You plagiarized, you outsourced, or if you were like me said fuck it, smoked some weed and went back to sleep. (Hard to believe I didn’t graduate, right?)

I don't mean to be harsh but I know from reading what you wrote that you can do better than this for an opening paragraph. 

Like I said you are on the right track. Keep going. Keep writing. Keep posting for critique. Never, ever stop. 


This is the most common feedback I hear about writing almost anything. Keeping it simple and direct. I often don't even add to discussions on Reddit because most of what I type out could just go without being said. It's difficult to find the best way of writing a story when it would be different in just an everyday conversation with your friend. I have so much trouble writing comedy because it's different making strangers laugh vs people you've known ten years. 

Thank you for the feedback. I didn't realize people were down voting it, I thought people were just ignoring it. I appreciate the feedback and I'll work harder on my next piece.

Also this is purely fiction, my penis is so big your Mom's hearing echoes when she pees.

Keep at it. Keep hanging around other comedy writers like us. You'll get there.

In fact, their motivations are incredibly noble: to create a society wherein everyone is treated equally and respectfully. However, the ways these groups go about executing their visions are severely flawed. And no, I'm not talking about the fact that say, feminism isn't about hating men (although this on its own deserves a whole thread). I'm talking about how these group's visions are too broad, which lead to loopholes that radical individuals can exploit. Again, let's look at feminism as an example. They advocate for more women to be placed into leadership positions in the government, but fail to specify that these women must also need to be held to the standards we set for male politicians in the past. Also, you can't just have female politicians popping up immediately. Perhaps because of the discrimination against women in politics in the past, few of them have considered a career in this field. Additionally, becoming a politician takes a very long time. The future female presidents or prime ministers might just be in school right now, hence why we are not yet seeing them. Thus, not having a 50/50 ratio of males and females in politics does not imply that the system is still biased against women (I'm not saying that it is not biased against women. In fact, I'm not drawing any conclusion here. Just pointing out that this argument is flawed)

243,TheGutterMonkey,Just more people cashing in on #MeToo. Reason will never win.,26,akreg8,https://www.reddit.com/r/MichaelJackson/comments/akreg8/just_more_people_cashing_in_on_metoo_reason_will/,3,2019-01-29 12:06:06,"This is going to be a lengthy rant. I apologize. lol

I remember doing a ton of research on Michael Jackson years back, not long after he died, and I feel like I learned a lot of things about the opportunistic nature of people, the allure of scandal to the public, and the propensity for most of us to assume the worst when given the option. I'd previously not been much of a fan of Jackson (I'm still not, to be honest) and I'd always assumed he was guilty of the stuff everyone had been talking about on TV and in the news. But, after his death, and all the hoopla about him, it sparked my interest (this eventually led to me writing a lengthy article on him). After reading up on all of his cases, I was shocked at how misled I was by the media and the subconscious persuasiveness of rumors and public opinion. And now, with this new documentary, it looks like it's all about to start up again.

I feel like I was taught a big lesson during the time I was learning about Jackson and how susceptible we all are to being misled. It became apparent to me (and is more relevant now than ever) how much easier it is for people to assume guilt than it is for them to withhold an opinion in the face of not enough evidence. And since people have lives to live, they don't bother wasting time doing any research on their own, hence why only the headlines make it into our conscience for most things. And what are the headlines? Only the juiciest and most scandalous seeming bits; because that's what gets the ratings, clicks, and sells the papers. We rarely think logically about any of this stuff on our own, we rarely look into matters more deeply, yet we nevertheless won't hesitate to jump to conclusions based on gut feelings and the limited information we've received. Following that, we become part of the problem as we then begin helping propel the rumors we've come to believe so hastily.

The best example of this, that I can think of, is with Michael's second accusers, the Arvizo family, who had a long history of trying to make easy money by conning people, made a list of outlandish claims, and where the parents had been caught in the past coaching their kids to lie. Yet all the general public seemed to pick up on and remember is that ""it's proven that Michael was accused by all these different, innocent kids, how could so many be lying?"" No. He was accused by two kids that we know of. One happily settled out of court (just check out Wikipedia to get a taste of that sordid tale), while the other was found to be lying by the court. And, as far as we know, that was it. It wasn't ""a lot"" (yet look at how telling it is that people believe it was) and the ones that there *were* are about as suspect as it gets. But very few seem to know that part of the story.

And now these new fellas have come out of nowhere after previously stating that Jackson did nothing to them. Could it be true? Sure. But it could also be yet another couple of people seeing an opportunity to cash in (and what better time to do so, with #MeToo and #BlackLivesMatter related witch hunts being the hot new trend). It doesn't matter if these guys are lying, because the allegation is all it takes to make you guilty in the people's eye. And since you can't prove a negative, that kind of guilt has no choice but to remain. The only options are for Jackson to be definitively proven guilty or for it to remain a mystery that people will assume is guilt anyway. That's how it always goes.

It's depressing to me that not only does this stuff still happen more than ever these days, but it's got people actually cheering it on like a crowd at a lynching (all thinking they're the ones with the moral high ground). I mean, I think that people generally have very good intentions with all of this stuff (it's what the road to Salem was paved with, as they say), but sadly lack critical thinking skills and, like all of us, are burdened with natural human errors in reasoning and suspicion. And they end up ruining more lives than they're saving with these kinds of witch hunts and ""just in case"" punishments and presumptions.

Perhaps the documentary will have a bombshell revelation in it, I don't know. But, if the past is any indicator, I somehow doubt it. Regardless, however, I only see this film going bad (no pun intended) for the memory of Jackson, as it's clearly designed with an agenda that he's guilty. And people are already inclined to have their torches and pitchforks ready anyway.","This is truly the most poignant and reasonable approach I’ve seen to this topic at hand, particularly minus the fandom bias. We, as a nation, feed upon said “juicy” headlines and don’t take the time to revisit the prior court hearings and intelligible legal findings that brought Jackson to innocence (aka facts). I appreciate your wholesome weigh-in, as someone who’s been a lifelong fan of Jackson.

Personally, I think they are both very important concepts and they were intended to bring about long overdue change, and I support them both.  The idea of those movements being nothing but witch hunts is exactly what the people benefitting from oppression want us to think and thus the original message gets muddied.

Your points and feelings are absolutely valid, though, and you are certainly right in thinking reason is a dying concept.

Agreed, great post and everything you say is completely true. Its just so hard to convince people, and I really think a rebuttal documentary is necessary this time around. The psychological shock factor trick seems to be working and people are starting to believe the lies again despite how many times they've been disproven.

But this is something that I wanted to get off my chest for a while now. 

I understand what people mean when they say ""all lives matter""; Black lives are also part of all lives, I get that. But I don't think that all lives truly matter;. I just don't There are people, that if they cease to exist, the world wouldn't be perfect by any means, but it'll definitely be a much better place than before. 

I'm talking about absolute scum of the earth; including the affluent, paramount leaders in their respective nations. Also pedophiles, rapists, gang-bangers who decapitate people to ""send a message""; men who get a rise out of abusing their partner, women vindictive enough to falsely accuse a man of rape, and so on... 

I mean, let's be honest, if these parasites didn't exist, the world would be much better off. Personally, I don't think their lives matter at all. Don't get me wrong, I won't be the one throwing a fiesta to celebrate their demise, but I definitely won't be shedding any tears or losing any sleep over it. And what really irks me when people say things like ""But bruh, you shouldn't say that. You should respect the dead."" 

I. Don't. Care.

Of course there are individuals who have made a huge positive impact in the world (Curie, Lincoln, Einstein, Mandela). But there also those who committed atrocities (Hitler, Stalin, Zedong, Castro) even more recent examples like the Mandalay Bay shooter, James Fields (Charlottesville), etc. I'm glad those people are dead. I think it's absolutely ridiculous that I (or anyone) can not berate or critique someone because they're dead or dying.

ooh so much edge

ok, which lives matter?

Why don’t the affluent matter, they are rich becuase they provided useful goods and services for millions of people which they made money off of.  The rich are also important to our economy as they are the highest investors.

We are just monkeys bro. Nothing matters.

Here's something that may be really unpopular. Did Hitler, Stalin, or any of the mega awful matter because their lives set history on a different course, leading the world to its present reality? I'd say they did. Anyone who possessed the power to alter the course of history clearly mattered. 

yes

No lives matter 

They’re still capable of doing terrible things to people.

Yes of course but so are the poor and so are the middle class, you listed the affluent as part of “the scum of the earth” though even though they can be very good people and many of them philanthropise.

The cop holding the rifle is black. I'm not saying this isn't an awful thing, but how is this a race thing?

To the anonymous downvoter: if you can’t understand how house music and rave culture have ALWAYS been political, have always upheld radical progressive values, you’re clueless. 

Of course anonymous downvotes are also just dysfunctional and passive aggressive, they are discouraged by the redditquette not to mention you just broke this subreddit's first rule. Sadly this is one of those bugs of the Reddit system mods are largely powerless to address. So congrats you just showed your ass and that’s all, and to be clear you’re not welcome here but this is an open forum and it’s going to stay that way. 

Cheers for the link DrD.

“I really can't say, I guess I laugh to keep from crying.
So much going on, people killing, people dying...”

Black people can be white supremacist. Women can be misogynist. Poor people can even be supporters of the oligarchy. There were African American slaveowners but slavery was still a white supremacist system. 

I don’t know the specific politics of Detroit. But the impression I got from the article is that this is maybe a somewhat upscale suburb and if it’s anything like my hometown, those enclaves were generally set up specifically as segregated communities intended to keep the “undesirable” (read: BLACK) element out. 

You need to get out more. 

Edit: okay in the interest of respect you can look into colourism. A lot of immigrants into the US report higher levels of abuse from Latinx BPA for example.

Just so you know, you may have not had an anonymous downvoter. Reddit uses something called “vote fuzzing” which means that the upvotes you see may not actually correlate directly to how many people actually voted. It’s an attempt to prevent bots and online marketing companies from manipulating the reddit system. Nobody outside of the reddit staff knows exactly how it works (for obvious reasons) but here’s one of the original explanations that made it into r/bestof

It's about the fact that we rely on these inspections to keep us from foodbourne disease and death!  These agents are responsible for checking around 80% of all domestic and international food products!  Most of the other 20% comes from the USDA inspectors who are currently still working, but unpaid.  If you've watched TV or been online in the past 50 years, you've probably noticed that reports of dozens (sometimes hundreds) of people getting hospitalized while handfuls of others are killed by Salmonella, E.coli, Hepatitis A, and Listeria have become fairly commonplace.  These are just some of the outbreaks as many smaller ones go un-/underreported.  Potentially deadly viruses and bacteria don't discriminate against race, gender, age, social class, religion, or anything else; they're equal opportunity, inperceptable killers and we've just lost our main line of defense against the ones that hide in our food.  

I've worked on assembly lines and other parts of production plants.  The ""IDGAF about quality, I just wanna get paid"" attitude runs rampant there and I seriously doubt the same isn't true in food processing and transportation industries.  This belief is particularly strong when it comes to food coming from other countries.  Not because I feel ""foreigners are evil"", but because it's human nature to care less about groups of people we believe we'll never know.  

Irrespective of any other political agendas, this event should legitimately cause massive panic and outrage and be treated like the very serious thread to the US people that it is. 

*steps off soapbox* ","It’s about that time we start pickin up some fire. 

100% with you! 

I am avoiding lettuce and hummus until this is over. Ecoli and Listeria are not on my list of goals for 2019. We just had huge meat recall at packing plant in AZ near where I live before the shut down. Makes me wonder if sticking to prepackaged foods or home cooked meals with lots of produce washing and hand washing and careful attention to temps is safe way to go right now. That or only going to restaurants that have had perfect scores on their past inspections. 

Just read on CNN that the FDA inspections are not shutdown.

Maybe it’s the government’s way of doing something about overpopulation 

They’re not halted, they are condensed. And considering the amount of immediate threats that we detect from inspections, we aren’t in any danger at all. Furthermore, much of FDA’s detection doesn’t even come from inspections. 

Millennium. This millennium. 

Definitely the latter. And thoroughly cooked meats... though I cringe at the thought of eating well done beef.

Didnt he fight for civil rights in the past? Feels like we are just trying to debate for no reason here... 

The whole ""blind spot when it comes to race"" talking point is classic projection. Neoliberals have a glaring (likely knowing and deliberate in many cases) blind spot when it comes to economic inequality, so they hyperfocus on other forms of inequality instead. So anyone whose eyes are fully open to the intersectionality of class with everything else must be smeared as ignoring social equality issues -- because that's much easier than actually confronting their own hypocrisy in ignoring something so major.

Pelosi is pro torture anti 4th amendment rich white woman. 

She speaks with right wing law enforcement regularly. This was her way of signaling support for the police. 

Sure thing.  I am a Bernie supporter.  I am basing comment on people’s comments.  Nancy is frustrating.  Nothing against your post.  You may have misinterpreted my post as against your posting.  I think it brings good valuable points.  The nitpicking has to do with peoples reasoning with issues with BLM.  They appear to be finding excuses to devalue the movement.  All I said.

Edit: I watched the video.

Bring on the smears! The more everyone smears (MSNBC, NYT, Corporate Dems, Corporate Establishment, etc.), the more idiotic they all look.

Uh oh, we've learned to look between the lines guys!

Bernie has a blind spot when it comes to race, but its a belief that black pundits actually care about their communities and judge men by the content of their character not by the size of the brown envelope they give them.  

BLM is has become a platform for well-off kids and self-seeking “activists” to seek fame and notoriety on the backs of real suffering of poor black people. I wouldn’t be surprised if in 2020 we see half of the “leaders” backing some corporate Democrat who will keep up the prison industrial complex just for a chance at that low-level political appointment or writing gig.

Also, their utter impotence is annoying to me. No leadership, no vision.

Aren’t we nitpicking here.  Bernie is supportive of BLM.  Didn’t he give the BLM member his 🎤 when they came on stage.  I thought he has acknowledged minorities more after the previous election.  I find it interesting people so defensive about a movement.  The movement is to use voice not force.  You don’t hear BLM member saying I will shoot them or “lock someone up”.  I think some aren’t used to seeing minorities speak up.  The energy they (people against BLM) have is related to themselves not BLM.  Freedom of speech goes both ways.  The individual is responsible for being compassionate or ignorant with their words.

Why are you using hashtags on Reddit..

And Bernie is now the most supported politician among black people. The “blind spot” bullshit couldn’t be further from the truth.

Agreed. I was in Seattle the day he announced Simeone Sanders, a prominent voice in the Black Lives Matter movement, a leading member of his campaign team. That shows he cares. 

He was made an ""honorary woman"" and was arrested in the fight for civil rights for crying out loud.  He displays more morality and courage in a month than most of these double standard ""no purity test for me, but 6th degrees of bacon purity test for you"" hypocrites display in their lifetime.

mcCaskill had a voter problem

its an establishment class problem.

To be fair, San Francisco must be the heart of Dixie, since Feinstein raised a confederate flag there when she was mayor. 

Bernie also said ""All Lives Matter"" during the 2016 election, and I agree with him 

He stopped saying it because of the backlash, but he obviously believes it, just as a majority of Americans do 

I don't mind that he won't say it anymore. There's more important fights to be fought 

He did and still does. 

Popularized by the Rove tactics.

Cool no worries, you're right on the money then.

I'm pretty sure you can google and find pictures of Bernie chained to a person of color and being arrested for it. So what blind spot are you talking about? 

&#x200B;

No one's nitpicking. Try better reading comprehension and watching the clip in the post.

It must be hard being out of touch. If you don’t understand the point of the movement they why are you on this page.

>Why are you using hashtags on Reddit..

Because they were part of the tweet, genius..

There seems to be an awful lot of outgoing Ds who lost their races but want to tell us which direction the party needs to go in order to win elections. It's a bit jarring.

Among Sanders, Hillary and O'Malley, Sanders was the only one who did not come back with ""All lives matter.""  And, while O'Malley dropped out, BLM, then funded by Soros, approved Bernie's social justice platform, not Hillary's.  Additionally, much earlier, when Dylann Roof shot a number of people in a Charlestown church in June 2015, Bernie immediately emailed his supporters and asked them to donate to the church.  At that time, Bernie REALLY could have used those donations himself.  

Aw well, look at me, posting as though 2016 made any sense.

rove projection.

Did you finish reading the comment?

he was snarking ...it was a pro bernie negative to corrupt leaders of the black community 

Next time don't quote something and put the hashtags after the quote ends.. genius.

No kidding, I just saw an interview with a Dem who LOST(in Indiana I believe), running on a conservative/Republican platform: supporting the wall, increase military spending, against Medicare4all, supported bush tax cuts, etc... 

He lost and he's telling the party/constituents how to win? Absolutely backwards

No. You could not be more wrong 

I'm a Bernie supporter who drove down to South Carolina from NY and campaigned for him 

The racial attacks on him during the election by mainstream Democrats were disgusting 


He said ""All Lives Matter"" 

Edit: https://www.vox.com/2015/7/20/9001639/bernie-sanders-black-lives-matter

I love Bernie to death, but when those BLM activists took the stage and refused to let Bernie speak in Seattle, I immediately developed this pit in my stomach, knowing he couldn't win. I still held out hope, but I just couldn't shake that feeling of hopelessness, that people he supported so fervently would treat him like such trash and such disrespect 

Can you find me that quote? Because it might seem to a lot of people like you are a lying piece of shit, since that quote doesn't seem to exist anywhere in that article. Well except for when O'Malley uses it.

I did not hear him say that on the video; and, from your source, Vox, always a cesspool of anti-Sanders slanting and bs:

Sanders was defensive and cranky toward the protesters, saying ""Black lives of course matter. But I've spent 50 years of my life fighting for civil rights. If you don't want me to be here, that's okay."" 

It is bs that Sanders was rude to the protestors. 

Paid whores. Look into the actual individuals who took that stage. 

Literally linked to it

I agree. Bernie should have thrown them off the stage.

He was nice and respectful of them. They repaid that kindness with hatred 

? Searching for ""all l"" on the page only finds this:  
   
>O'Malley, attempting to respond to the protesters, said, ""Black lives matter. White lives matter. All lives matter"" — a phrase that's been used by critics of the #BlackLivesMatter movement, and which activists see as an attempt to dismiss racial disparities in police shootings. O'Malley later told MSNBC that he wasn't aware of the connotations of ""all lives matter,"" which is itself pretty illustrative of the disconnect between O'Malley and the #BlackLivesMatter movement.

Are you stupid? I already said there is no such quote in the article, and there is no such quote in the video.

Why are you lying?

He said it at that event, the video has it iirc 

I was there 

Then surely, you won't have trouble finding video of this?

But let's say, just for the sake of argument, this happened. Back in 2015, it isn't unimaginable he may not have fully understood the phrase ""black lives matter"" means *also* rather than *exclusively* at first. As the clip in the original post shows, however, he became better informed in short order regarding this phrase.

Mind you, that's the *worst case* scenario, without consideration for missing context. Meaning *at worst* Bernie took the time to better listen and inform himself.

Why are you lying?

I linked it

I'm sorry, dude(sse?) .. Literally that link you posted has only o'malley saying all lives matter (I quoted the paragraph above) and a collage-type video of how Bernie is winning the internet, literally nothing about any lives mattering.  
  
At least 5 people have commented about looking at your link. At the point where it seems you're wasting people's time, they get snippy.  
  
Is this really the link you meant to post in your comment above?  
   
https://www.vox.com/2015/7/20/9001639/bernie-sanders-black-lives-matter

He said it at that event. I linked the correct article. Sorry I can't reply further, this is tedious 

I would want to know and have a clip. Hard to believe that shareblue didn't capture such vid & amplify the hell out of it, negatively.  
  
Good luck, wherever your path takes you!

Choking breaks every bone in the body?

I don't want to read the story as I would prefer to have a decent night.

Sometimes, the Police are tasked to deal with the most horrific scenarios that can involve minors and their deaths.  My heart goes out to them.

Other times, it has been the Police that have created the horrific scenarios.

I'd like to believe we'll all start behaving better as of now.

This is sickening. 

Access denied. Why?

Even if Jesus Christ came back from his vacation and baked those gotdamned cookies himself, that still wouldn't excuse your reaction. 

The fuck wrong with you people...

Excuse me what the fuck?

Law Enforcement: Unarmed kids can only be killed by us

Women have killed my children than any other group in history.

I hope you guys get hung or beaten for the rest of your pathetic life you are p****** hope you get what’s coming to you when your a***** are in prison how could you do that to this little boy worthless P*****

This is really fucked up, but I'm not sure how this is a men's rights issue.

>They must have known they were going down. Not even an attempt to create a reasonable story. 

My ex is emotionally disturbed.  Not ""ha ha, bitchy women, right?"", but currently incarcerated.  One of the things that took me a really long time to figure out is **just how little effort women need to expend**.  Society wants to believe them.  

It was so alien to me that it just didn't register.  I was caught up in it, just like everyone else.  Even when she turned it on me, I wasn't any kind of prepared for it.  They don't have to be geniuses.  They don't even have to have a plan.  In a lot of cases, women can say any damn thing that pops into their head, and it often works.  

Once I caught on, I noticed that even my ex wasn't sure how the fuck it worked.  She would say something outrageous, and then look around a bit to see if the magic was working.  And it usually did.  

There are variables here besides just being female, but female is the main one.  

Anyhoo...  My poorly made point is that I wouldn't take the weakness of their story as them giving up.  



>Choking breaks every bone in the body?

No way. He fell asleep and *that* is what broke every bone in his body. The army of roaches living in the house probably could have done it as well. Haven't you learned the lesson of #MeToo? *Women never lie.*

Doesn't matter. It will all be over soon. 

This lifetime will experience the end of humankind.

I think humanity is the problem

Humanity is the problem.

Kid stole a cupcake, owners (two sisters) beat him to death and say he choked on it. 

It’s a misleading title. The police didn’t beat the kid his sisters did. 

They also get pissed when an unarmed child is killed...by anyone except themselves.

Sickening to think about

tbh in the past it was probably men but for sure in the 21st century it's women

The poster is saying that the women will get away with it because they are women.

> Once I caught on, I noticed that even my ex wasn't sure how the fuck it worked. She would say something outrageous, and then look around a bit to see if the magic was working. And it usually did.

Ahh, but I do love it when a dim-bulb gets caught in her web of lies. They *never* seem to see it coming. 

You're absolutely right.  I witnessed this in the case of a friend going through a marriage break-up with involvement from social services in the UK.  Every so often the wife would make some sort of allegation against him, the most serious being that he had raped her.  On being challenged she would have to admit that what she was alleging had not happened, but there was no comeback on her whatsoever.  It was as if she had said nothing and people were pretending it hadn't happened.  It was just the same when people realised that instead of the husband being violent, it was she who had hit him, and he hadn't retaliated.  Nothing mattered so long as it was the man who was the victim.  As you say, the woman uses her social power like a magic spell, and even when it doesn't work she won't be held responsible.

Wow, that's messed up. Do you think you'd be able to write a bit more about it for www.menarehuman.com or let me quote what you have already written.

Tldr version: ""nah bro they ain't quit""

> He fell asleep and that is what broke every bone in his body.

An old friend woke up one day, sat up in bed and his arm fell out of it's socket. Dislocated shoulder, 12 months recovery. Beds can be a very dangerous place. 

Found the AI, guys.

You are correct!

I did gather that from the title, they used the full colon after Police.

Clearly, that's what happened to this boy. Except, yanno, to every single bone.

How special 

I was accused yesterday of luring my husband into marriage and exploiting alleged power imbalances between us. 

Um. My husband was a special forces sniper in his military. Just because he doesn't make as much money as I do doesn't mean he's simple, easy to fool, or exploitable. He chose to ask me to marry him and I chose to accept. 

But someone on this forum kept telling me how I was essentially taking advantage of him because I made more money. 

Newsflash. We didn't bust out our bank accounts when we started dating. We fell in love. All of this nonsense? Is nonsense. Stop looking for alleged slights and insinuation.

The world would be a lot better off that way. 

I like your post history

Think about the same as you do :) 

This

I apologise for the difficulty I had in expressing my thoughts clearly, a better summary: 

- I believe it’s much more beneficial to work together and acknowledge that are problems are collective

I can acknowledge that I don’t have the greatest depth of education in this area, but I just feel that being told everything is the male gender’s fault and that male issues are inferior seems contradictory given that they’re fighting about sexism. And then words like ‘mansplaining’ are thrown around whereas there’d be protests if a man used a similar word to describe a woman’s actions.

I just struggle to understand the hypocrisy of radicalists who fight for sexism with sexism

I just struggle to understand why radicalists try to eliminate sexism by using sexism against men, even basic things like saying ‘mansplaining’ when they would protest if a man said ‘womansplaining

I understand your points and I appreciate it, I’m also sorry to hear about your experiences on the sub

It's a trip 

I’m not sure if that’s sarcastic, but if it is, my choice of posts based on my career have no negative impact on equality

If you check out r/menslib, you'll find discussions that intersect feminism with men's issues. Maybe that will be interesting and shed some light on how these discussions can go better.

It's not sarcastic

WASHINGTON — With the unveiling here Monday at the [National Portrait Gallery](http://npg.si.edu/) of the official presidential likenesses of Barack Obama and the former first lady, Michelle Obama, this city of myriad monuments gets a couple of new ones, each radiating, in its different way, gravitas (his) and glam (hers).

&#x200B;

[https:\/\/www.wildfuture.net\/collections\/canvas\/products\/canvas-gormitolo-12x16](https://preview.redd.it/tpgg60lg2j521.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=0790651fac6269c27165677d243ceaafdb94ac2a)

Ordinarily, the event would pass barely noticed in the worlds of politics and art. Yes, the Portrait Gallery, part of the Smithsonian Institution, owns the only readily accessible complete collection of presidential likenesses. But recently commissioned additions to the collection have been so undistinguished that the tradition of installing a new portrait after a leader has left office is now little more than ceremonial routine.

The present debut is strikingly different. Not only are the Obamas the first African-American presidential couple to be enshrined in the collection. The painters they’ve picked to portray them — [Kehinde Wiley](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/27/arts/design/kehinde-wiley-obama-portrait-london-exhibition.html?module=inline), for Mr. Obama’s portrait; [Amy Sherald](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/arts/design/amy-sherald-michelle-obama-official-portrait.html?module=inline), for Mrs. Obama — are African-American as well. Both artists have addressed the politics of race consistently in their past work, and both have done so in subtly savvy ways in these new commissions. Mr. Wiley depicts Mr. Obama not as a self-assured, standard-issue bureaucrat, but as an alert and troubled thinker. Ms. Sherald’s image of Mrs. Obama overemphasizes an element of couturial spectacle, but also projects a rock-solid cool.

\[[Read our interview Kehinde Wiley](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/27/arts/design/kehinde-wiley-obama-portrait-london-exhibition.html?module=inline) | [Read our interview with Amy Sherald](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/arts/design/amy-sherald-michelle-obama-official-portrait.html?module=inline)\]

It doesn’t take #BlackLivesMatter consciousness to see the significance of this racial lineup within the national story as told by the Portrait Gallery. Some of the earliest presidents represented — George Washington, Thomas Jefferson — were slaveholders; Mrs. Obama’s great-great grandparents were slaves. And today we’re seeing more and more evidence that the social gains of the civil rights, and Black Power, and Obama eras are, with a vengeance, being rolled back.

___________________________________________________________________________________

Good afternoon /r/menslib. Today I want to talk to you about Jordan Peterson. Or, rather, I want to talk to you about the worldview that creates men like Jordan Peterson and his followers. I want to take you through the role that privilege takes in shaping our worldviews, and give a few examples of when I had my own privilege checked - and how that changed my political beliefs and turned me into the woke SJW that is now writing this essay.

First, some housekeeping:

* This isn't going to be a ""takedown"" where a WOKE SJW SMASHES SMUG PETERSONHEAD. I'm going to be spending very little time criticizing Peterson's beliefs, and much more time talking about how his belief-system is formed, and why his followers have little issue believing him.
* I... am not a big fan of Jordan Peterson. This essay will be heavily biased against him, with editorialized presuppositions about his incorrectness being made. This is because, once again, this isn't a takedown, this is an essay examining the role privilege plays in shaping how we approach issues of social justice. There are many, many resources online for those interested in criticizing the specifics of Peterson's various claims.
* I'm hoping this essay will inspire at least a few who read it. If you have your own stories of having your privilege checked, please put them in the comments!
* My apologies to /u/pantsdancing, to whom I promised I would do an essay on The Left Hand of Darkness. It's coming! ...Eventually!

# A Masturbatory Meritocracy

This essay was inspired by [this video](https://www.facebook.com/EducateInspireChange.org/videos/2405878246153410/?hc_ref=ARTImkJirmJtydKEKtaKlKyc4AGL6vBKYF_48_eU6cHGMGG8VZ-X072gAye6Yasje1Y&__xts__[0]=68.ARBx6vEQnZ34G_GLFVgcrhJ8VoK5ZpLjoPFSRCfQMTm6uRGf91AEnMoUYbom_s9o5kqTgCAjYL1mmm-6rHYaIZrvqvAIGdFh6t8J47Ql_4okMZtEBA3dCYyCKeShuUYyqX02_CPlNTm0xFks--mUpYCehBu2GbMvcyUwk726JaryKDUm_E1vDX14oOjnRx7M_TrtP47DzgHslyx85-SVJR8L-9SOp-52A-ehmhByrc8HhMGVbT2_s0Yzwzvv7ino-EOZtfrHv1YgNUeQPYN1W-B3q6AQuFCy_Dm2cEZ_WDxqUCthApNXJ-N14BVSR_TMabiOzgspqH2PLnUPEgr23rATegu4P1oW3kx0jA&__tn__=FC-R) (Warning: Facebook link, you do not need an account) titled ""Jordan Peterson Completely Destroyed Feminist Narrative"", and, more specifically, this line at 1:30:

>""Western societies of male-dominated patriarchy"" - it's like, no it's not! That not true! And and even if it, even if it has a patriarchal structure to some degree the er... **the fundamental basis of that structure is not power, it's competence.**

Now, at face value, this is just a laughable thing to say. Firstly, to say that power and competency are mutually exclusive within any system is like saying the fundamental basis of the structure of the universe isn't energy, it's matter. But more importantly, it places blind faith in a Western meritocracy, assuming a society where there are no inherently disadvantaged people - only the best and the rest.

Now, if you're a fan of Jordan Peterson, you're probably already typing a comment about how I took this quote out of context. And you're right, as Peterson often argues that the meritocracy *does* work, and the basis for this is some fundamental difference between the sexes. I disagree with most of Peterson's sentiments regarding the fundamental differences of gender. But, here's the thing, *the video is not arguing about that -* the only thing it's claiming to those who view it is that there is a meritocracy in the West, and that any narrative of discrimination is fundamentally flawed because of this.

This video was shared by a friend of mine yesterday. Needless to say, it **triggered** me, and I commented with my own criticism. My friend replied with this sentiment, and I'm paraphrasing here: ""I believe that the value we are given as people is based on the things that we do"". This is the viewpoint I want to examine and criticize today, and the commonality amongst Peterson's followers. They believe, at a fundamental level, that, ***because we live in a liberal society with supposedly egalitarian social policy, all people essentially operate on equal footing, and any stratification that occurs is the result of personal moral failing or biology.*** There is room for nuance in individual cases, but any narrative of an overarching systemic bias is untrue (or so they believe).

This is... an optimistic view of the world. It is a worldview built upon **privilege**. Basically, it's easy to turn around and say that society is inherently meritocratic, when you are part of a demographic that has never had to face systemic discrimination. And, I will admit to you now, I used to be one of the people that believed this.

Sure, I believed, sexism is a thing that happens sometimes, but there's no *laws* that prevent women from advancing in society. Sure, racism is a thing that happens, but if Black people haven't committed any crimes, they shouldn't be worried about police stops. Sure, diversity is important, but all of our institutions should be staffed solely on merit, and ""diversity quotas"" are counter-productive.

And, even when I started my Anthropology degree, and started getting a better understanding of exactly how systemic discrimination manifests and generally looking at the world more critically, I was still reluctant to renege on my Libertarian-esque worldview that all people are essentially born with the same potential within society. It wasn't until I entered adulthood and ended up running into checks of my own privilege that I really began to understand how important it is to view prejudice critically. I'd like to share a few anecdotes now of times when I had my privilege checked, and how I viewed the world differently because of this.

# Epiphanies of Entitlement

**1) Cat-calling**

A few years ago, I began to not cut my hair. Slowly, but surely, my curly-wavy hair began to get longer and longer. While at first I wasn't sure exactly how treat my hair, some research into the ""curly girl"" style of maintenance led me to a proper, sulfate-free shampoo-conditioning regimen.

I'm a stand-up comedian on the side, and thus travel alone, at night, to various shows to perform. I don't have a car, so I usually take the bus. I usually wear skinny-jeans and tight-fitting shirts, in order to look my best on stage. I also have a very slim figure with a skinny waist and [feminine hips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3466z8Xsf0).

If you can't see where I'm going with this: basically, I can be mistaken for a woman if you were to only see my silhouette at night.

So, when I was walking to the bus stop after a set one night, I ended up being cat-called. It was by a large guy, who was pretty clearly intoxicated. As a man of small-stature, I was a bit intimidated. He began calling at me, but I walked briskly away.

Fast-forward to another show a month later. I get cat-called again by a different man, also larger than me. This time, the guy starts walking after me. It was only when I turned around and he saw my facial hair that he changed tact (and asked me for $5, which I refused).

At this point, I start to become scared about walking home alone at night. I was suddenly made aware of this privilege I had, that I didn't even know existed. I was also aware of how it affected my ability to go to shows. Now, I had to ask friends for rides, or only go to certain places at certain times of day, or only walk around at night when other people were around. *Just by vaguely looking like a woman, I was already at a distinct disadvantage in where and when I could go to stand-up comedy*.

Of course, instead of suffering, I started putting my hair up into a classic man-bun when I walked the streets. And, just like that, my privilege was regained. But most women don't have that luxury.

**2) Police Interactions**

I was sitting with two co-workers, one white and one Blackfoot, and the white coworker was explaining a drunken adventure he had the previous night. As the story goes, he was visibly inebriated, and walking home from the bar. Apparently, he was so drunk, he decided to sit alongside the sidewalk and began puking. A cop suddenly appeared before him.

""Well, then he asked 'Are you drunk?' and I was like 'Yeah',"" my white coworker explained, ""And then he asked how I was getting home. So I told him, I didn't know. So he said, 'Ok, well you seem nice enough, let's drive you home.""

I was just sitting there nodding, as this seemed like a reasonable interaction, when my Blackfoot coworker suddenly said, ""Well that's a huge double-standard...""

At first, it didn't even register to me what he was talking about. He had spoken so casually, I didn't understand what he saying. It wasn't until I got home after work and I went through the conversation in my head, that I suddenly realized what he meant. If it were a Blackfoot man sitting drunken on the curb, rambling at the police, he would have definitely been arrested, if not worse.

The real question is why this was such a stunning revelation for me. I knew that First Nations were not treated as equitably by the police (or anybody else, for that matter), in our city. But I suppose I was always detached from this inequity. It wasn't until I heard a story where I could have been in the person's shoes that I was suddenly able to empathize with the double-standard. I've been drunk, alone, on the streets before. It was a sudden revelation that *I could have lived my life the exact same as I have, and been in the exact same situation, and because of my skin colour had a completely different outcome*.

Ever since this revelation I've moved into open support of movements like #blacklivesmatter. I suppose my point behind this anecdote is that opportunistically calling out privilege can be just as powerful as losing privilege.

**3) Safe Spaces**

I am ethnically Jewish, descended from Holocaust survivors. For the most part, aside from occasionally having ignorant bumfucks ask me to not ""Jew"" them out of things, I don't face any particular discrimination for this. I am acutely aware of the history behind the Holocaust, my mother was an administrator in charge of holocaust education in our region for many years. That being said, I am generally willing to overlook some ignorance on the topic amongst laymen, and, as a stand-up comedian, I don't tend to be offended by holocaust jokes, understanding they don't come from a place of ignorance or malevolence.

I also quite enjoy the game [Secret Hitler](https://secrethitler.com/). In fact, I really get into it, putting on an over-the-top German accent and accusing others of being fascists while I secretly plot to put mein fuhrer into the chancellorship.

I had some friends over playing this game a year ago, and we were having a good time accusing one another of all sorts of deception. At the end of the first game, an acquaintance arrived and joined us for another round. They immediately accused the person sitting next to them of being Jewish. We all laughed, and play moved on. Then, this acquaintance made another accusation of Jewishness. We all laughed again - myself included, as I wasn't unused to roleplaying antisemitism in this game. And then... other people started to accuse each other of being Jews, and then those people responded in kind, and suddenly we entered a five minute stand-still of accusatory Jewishness. And I became uncomfortable.

There was no rational reason for this. I know my friends aren't antisemitic, that they're just joking and role-playing. And the whole time, I sat there silently, telling myself this over and over. It became apparent to me that my discomfort wasn't rational. But that didn't make my feelings any less real.

At the end of the round (my team lost), I excused myself from the table and sat down in my room. My mind began racing, trying to rationalize my social anxiety. And I suddenly realized that *I needed a safe space. A safe space from things that were just jokes, things I had no rational reason to dislike.*

Suddenly, I had a lot more empathy for those who deride certain comedy shows, or refuse to allow certain comedians to perform in their venues.

# Presenting Privilege

So, you have a friend who's a big fan of Jordan Peterson. Maybe they like to argue for the Non-Aggression Principle, or how #alllivesmatter. Maybe they believe in the immutability of sex, or they insist on not using a person's preferred pronoun, or they mock safe-spaces.

I am suggesting to you it is highly likely that your friend has lived a life of privilege.

They've probably never been cat-called while walking down the street and feared for their safety.

They've probably never felt alienated at a workplace because of sexual harassment.

They've probably never had trouble at university because they were raised in a low-income household, and never had the means to acquire the social norms of the middle-class.

They've probably never been pulled over at a traffic stop and immediately started fearing for their life.

They've probably never had to sit through a comedian make a bunch of rape jokes and had to relive their own trauma.

They've probably never had to go see a doctor on the other side of the city, and waited outside for an hour because there's only one handi-bus to accommodate them.

They've probably never spent most of their youth feeling the wrong gender, then been told that the gender they did choose won't be acknowledged because the speaker can't be bothered to empathize with them.

And I think the best way to engage these people isn't to get on their level. It's fine to go over their points, bring up your own sources, and engage them in good faith, if you want to convince the others reading of your stance. But if you want to engage the privileged person, and really change their worldview, you're going to need to make them aware of their own privilege. Tell them stories like I've told you. Ask them about the things they've accomplished, and point out how those accomplishments could have gone differently if they didn't have their privilege.

[Liberals have this fantasy, and I say this with lots of love, that they can engage a person in reasoned debate, come up with a bunch of witty, well-sourced rationale, and then suddenly have their opponent either shut up or have a change of heart.](https://youtu.be/wmVkJvieaOA?t=384) But if you really want someone to change, you're going to need to engage them emotionally. I believe the best, and most moral, way of accomplishing this is by engaging their sense of empathy.

If you are reading this and are a fan of Jordan Peterson, this *is* a personal attack on you - I won't pull any punches. But before you go into the comments ranting about how woke you actually are, I want you to take the time to think about where you are in life. How if you were a different gender, or race, or nationality, or differently abled, your life would have ended up differently. The next time you see a friend who is a ""minority"", ask them about their experiences with discrimination, and think about if you've been in any similar circumstances in life that turned out differently.

Anyways, thanks for reading! Happy holidays everybody!","A few years ago my gf and I had an arguement because she always wanted me to walk her home from places when she went out at night but I didn't want to have to leave the house to go meet her. 

I used to be very much of the mentality that everybody has an equal experience in modern society and argued that there's nothing to be scared of because as a small man I wouldn't be able to fight anyone off any better than she would and I don't feel scared, so her fear was irrational.

In the end I apologised after having a realisation that it doesn't matter if her fear was or wasn't irrational all that matters is the fear is real to her in the moment and I could help reduce that if I walked her home. So as her boyfriend I should do it regardless of my thoughts because it made her feel safer.

Fast forward to maybe a year ago and I've grown my hair out so it comes down to my shoulder blades. Normally I'd wear it tied up simply because I spend a good bit of time outside and its windy where I live so I'd always get hair in my eyes and mouth. 

One day the weather was calm and I decided to wear my hair down for a change. I got catcalled and suddenly understood what my girlfriend was feeling years ago. All of a sudden her fear went from ""irrational but still real"" to ""totally rational"" and I saw things much clearer from her point of view. I've had a few of these moments of clarity and they've slowly shifted my view to be more acknowledging of my privilege.

This was a really great post. Saving it to share around. 

I'm not a Peterson type (I probably would have been had he been popular around 4-5 years ago), but I used to eat up anti-SJW, reactionary content back in high school (5 years ago). And the thing is, I was still politically liberal, just socially right-leaning because of their rhetoric. 

I'm half black, and now that I'm a bit older and about as far-left as it gets, it boggles my mind to see black people spouting the same Petersonian, alt-right, anti-SJW, reactionary, whatever-you-want-to-call-it narratives. But this post helped put my high school years, and I imagine these anti-SJW minorities, into perspective. 

I never really *faced* *discrimination strictly on my race*. Sure, I'd been called stuff like ""oreo"" or whatever by kids at school and sometimes questioned my racial identity, but I was never directly targeted because of my skin tone. So for people like me, who, **despite being a minority, wield a fair amount of privilege,** it became very easy to dismiss *actual* struggles of other minorities, women, LGBT, etc as inadequate or exaggerated because, after all, *I'm different looking and nothing's happened to me.* 

Thankfully, going to a really liberal university got me out of that mindset very quickly once I learned that my experiences aren't universal to everybody. If anything, I got *really, really* lucky growing up avoiding any kind of discrimination.

> A Masturbatory Meritocracy

I want to comment on this line before reading the entire essay because it uses two words I've used myself when discussing the issues I expect you to discuss, it makes me happy, and it also makes me slightly worried that using expressions like these might make your audience self-select.

Something that always springs to mind when I read this kind of stuff is [this extremely long tweetstorm](https://twitter.com/cmMcConnaughy/status/996099445778452480)

[(here's an easier-to-read version if you don't like twitter)](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/996082522512609285.html)

>Look, it is hard to live a hard life like my dad did—to work so hard you die young—and still be told that you owe others more. That’s true. You just might resent the people saying it. And part of your resentment would be justified. But not all of it. 19/

>It is harder still when the people you allegedly owe more to aren’t real to you. When American apartheid means you don’t have life experiences to teach you about race in the way you would need to understand it. We did not know any black people! 20/

>I mean, this is part of the “how can I be racist?!” refrain. How can you be when you never encounter black people to be unfairly mean to? How are you the problem—you didn’t DO anything? And honestly—you WOULD be nice to them (you believe). 21/

>And of course all you know about black people is what the TV tells you. It has some doing fine—becoming President even. It also tells you lots of crime is committed by black people. How do you put this together? 22/

>Well, here come the elites to explain it all to you. Are you an under-appreciated hard worker (yes)? OR are you getting privileges others don’t (yes)? If those are presented to you as **alternatives**—which one do you choose?

This certainly, *100%* does not apply to all the Peterson-style folks, but I've found that it's a significant percentage of them. They grew up surrounded by a sea of people just like them. They might have dipped a toe outside it occasionally, but they are really, really comfortable thinking that everyone is just *an individual*, and that systems and societal norms and culture don't *really* matter. ""Abstract all groups down to the level of the individual"", as Peterson says.

Some of this is just meeting people who are not like you. Some of this is just having more and different experiences. But some of this is also *just plain empathy*. Listening to other perspectives and believing them instead of seeing them as an opportunity to debate. Accepting that folks who aren't like you have experienced the world differently. 

And that's the part that these dudes miss. Empathy. Just like, the most basic possible level of human-to-human understanding. 

Your example of cat-calling was similar to my own wake-up call regarding privilege. I used to live near the gay village in my city, and after being cat-called after while just walking to work one day, it really struck me how uncomfortable that is.

Then there was that video that went around a few years ago of that woman just walking around NYC for a few hours, where they put together an edit showing the *hundreds* of catcalls she received in that time. It didn't take much for me to put two and two together and realize how uncomfortable it must be to just live your life under those conditions.

One thing I like about Reddit is that everyone assumes I'm a white man. It gives my voice more authority in a way. In reality I am a white woman who has a mental disorder that has it so I am on disability. I am often discredited and ignored. But here, on my alt accounts especially, people can't see me so they can only go by the words I type.

Reddit is the place where I have privilege, as long as I don't reveal to much about myself. Its interesting to see the other side, and I can see why they don't want to give it up. But unlike them, when I set my phone down or log off my computer, I have to go back to a world where I am less and my experiences matter less. 

I see this a lot right now. I am in a computer science program and doing quite well. I've offered to help some of the guys that are struggling but they act like I know nothing. I've started switching to only using my initials for websites like Github and Stack overflow, just so they don't see a girl's name and ignore the content or questions. It sucks because I don't have gender dysphoria, and I am not trans, but some of my online personas are male just so I can be relevant. 

I wonder if these men, like Jordan Peterson, have ever had to change or lie about fundamental aspects of themselves just to not be ignored. I wonder if any of them are truly capable of empathizing with people in situations different from their own. With people I know who follow Jordan Peterson and people like him they are able to empathize with me personally, but not a race or gender as a whole. It's like ""Yeah, you have a disability, but you work hard to better yourself so that means all disabled people can do that too!"" Except I couldn't go to college until I was 29. I didn't have a license untill 28, and I am still unable to have a year round job. They don't look at those as negative because they know me and how far I've come. But they don't know the other people with a similar disability to mine and don't know how hard ""bettering yourself"" can be. I've heard the argument that they have a black friend who doesn't care if they use the n word so no black people should care. It is very hard to see beyond yourself.

I feel that this I am rambling a bit, and I'm sorry for that. 

Thank you, I really enjoyed reading this. 

Great post. I went through a similar period of not understanding how privilege works near the end of my time in high school, though mine was even worse (while I was thankfully not at all vocal about my views, I was definitely secretly anti-SJW, didn’t believe that the wage gap was the result of sexism, thought that racism still existed but was overblown by “SJWs”, etc). For me, along with the obvious sources of these views (I was a white male from a wealthy family who lived a sheltered life), another important factor was that I was also going through a period of extreme depression. Basically, my thought process was “how can people say that life is so easy for me when every single day sucks and I want to kill myself literally all the time?” In my case, I think I changed my views mostly because I became more educated about just how pervasive discrimination is in society, and also because watching footage of some of the police killings of unarmed black people (particularly Eric Garner) really opened my eyes to how unfair certain aspects of society are

>This is... an optimistic view of the world. It is a worldview built upon **privilege**. Basically, it's easy to turn around and say that society is inherently meritocratic, when you are part of a demographic that has never had to face systemic discrimination. And, I will admit to you now, I used to be one of the people that believed this.

Glad to see this in print. Libertarian/Petersonian/""anti-SJW"" types build their arguments on the flawed presumption that we are *already* living in a just and equitable society, rather than we are actively *moving toward* one and *away* from a society that codifies advantage for a select group of people. 

White supremacy and patriarchy were the dominant frames of social/political/economic realities in the US for centuries. As such, our institutions reflect that. So even though one may think that ""we are all equal"" bc the letter of the law has changed from ""for whites"" to ""for all,"" they are ignoring the impact the 400+ years of codified white supremacy and patriarchy have had on both on our systems and institutions as well as on our collective consciousness.

You're right about the ""liberal fantasy"" of engaging those who make this mistake w facts and figures and changing their minds. I actually lead ""Racial Justice"" workshops for a living, and the process of getting ppl to just a basic understanding that the laws of the US were, until the 1970s, explicitly and intentionally racist, and that that history *does* have bearing on our present moment takes three full days of group work. My goal is to just get people to the point where they consider this question: ""Have you done all the thinking you need to do about race/racism and/or privilege?"" If the answer is no (it always is), then what are you going to do about that?

Thanks for sharing OP, this was really eye opening. I have never been a fan of Peterson however I remember times in college, acquaintances would suggest I read his new book and I would just politely refuse and I just graduated in the summer of 2018. 

When I was younger I totally thought we advanced in society through merit. “If you work hard you will get where you want to go.” However I don’t have the same experiences as the OP but I really appreciated him sharing his experiences. I came from a poor upbringing being told college wasn’t an option from school counselors, due to family’s financial limitations. Regardless I remember being in college and working in a factory with a lot of work release programs from prisons, some ex-felons, and immigrants. To be completely honest I loved working with all these people. They gave me insight from a life I wasn’t seeing in my classes in college. I would sit next to someone in my classes who would call these people I work with terrible people regardless of circumstance or ever meeting them because they heard how bad they are on the news or read it in an article. But when I worked with those people at night they would ask me how my classes went, did I study for my exams, and encourage me to keep going and graduate, they really just wanted the best for me. In addition they taught me how to speak Spanish better, I could only read it and understand it verbally previously. Meanwhile all they were doing was punching the clock trying to provide a life for themselves and their families just as I was, however my responsibility was paying for school were theirs was supporting their family the only way they knew how. They would work so hard just to keep their job in terrible conditions because finding job isn’t always easy when you have those confines placed on you from society.  

To be completely honest the factory job we had was awful with terrible conditions, however I’m so thankful for those two years I worked there because I made me a better person plus it really helped me pay for school. Plus those individuals are some of the hardest working individuals you will ever meet in your life and they helped me improve my work ethic which helped me so much in future employment at a desk job and my studies. In addition this experience has made me very cynical regarding our society, because I often feel like I have advanced in society not just because I’ve work hard, I have, however I’m not naive enough to believe I did it all on my own and didn’t get help and get a little bit lucky. However before my time in the factory I believed that merit will get you far in life, and I live in America and the American dream I witnessed in the factory was a dream for their next generation and that was humbling.

Very well written! Thank you for sharing your life experiences! I liked your note about wanting people to change - my standby is ""You can't reason a person out of a position they didn't reason themselves into."" with the same implications.

Just wanted to thank you for your well-rounded post. It seems like our values had already aligned; BUT this also challenged me to refine my own beliefs in a whole new way.

This whole comment section is really productive too. I really appreciate it.

Here are some of mine:

Women's fears concerning men: Found out about the scariness of male anger to women by stepping toward my mom briskly while arguing about where I should go to college.  That fear in her eyes is seared in my head.  Felt a bit like a monster.

Systemic racism:  She taught at a community college in a poorer, black neighborhood and too many of the students didn't know how to use a computer and had major reading problems.  Also, Ferguson.

Microaggressions:  Dad got a ""Oh, do they drive cars in Mexico?  I thought everyone rode around on donkeys.""  Dude's car was made in Mexico.

Class issues:  This NPR article echos some of my feelings about going to college with a bunch of [Super Rich Kids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tM8B01BkKTs):  ['Going To Office Hours Is Terrifying' And Other Tales Of Rural Students In College](https://www.npr.org/2018/12/12/668530699/-going-to-office-hours-is-terrifying-and-other-hurdles-for-rural-students-in-col)

Trans issues:  Some weirdness at a women's college nearby regarding trans men.  TERF wars.

Affirmative action: [This segment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zm5QVcTI2I8) of the show Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj was good.  Having parents/community who invest in your education--major advantage.

Problems with the label socialism:  Talk to an older Cuban or Nicaraguan about Castro and the Sandinistas.

Genocide: Crush on a Bosnian girl in elementary school eventually lead me to learning about the [Bosnian War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosnian_War).

> The next time you see a friend who is a ""minority"", ask them about their  experiences with discrimination, and think about if you've been in any  similar circumstances in life that turned out differently. 

&#x200B;

And the next time you see your friend and ask them this, don't get defensive or try to explain how what they're experiencing isn't ""special"" in any way. I know lots of would-be Petersonians who would immediately go on the defensive when hearing from their friend. 

Instead, just listen, and listen, and listen, and be sympathetic. If you hear enough of these stories, you'll eventually see that discrimination is not an isolated event, but a pattern that tries to disrupt your life. One story of someone-being-mean-to-you is not all you need to *explain away the problems* that are ever-present in other peoples' lives.

&#x200B;

You know, normally I'd be playing as much of a devil's advocate as you can for people praising a guy arguing at straw metanarratives like they are postmodernist, but this was actually quite a good read. Thank you for sharing with us. 

>My friend replied with this sentiment, and I'm paraphrasing here: ""I believe that the value we are given as people is based on the things that we do"". This is the viewpoint I want to examine and criticize today, and the commonality amongst Peterson's followers. They believe, at a fundamental level, that, because we live in a liberal society with supposedly egalitarian social policy, all people essentially operate on equal footing, and any stratification that occurs is the result of personal moral failing or biology. There is room for nuance in individual cases, but any narrative of an overarching systemic bias is untrue (or so they believe).


Interesting, i suggest reading this article if you want to dig on the subject https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-world_hypothesis

>The just-world hypothesis or just-world fallacy is the cognitive bias (or assumption) that a person's actions are inherently inclined to bring morally fair and fitting consequences to that person, to the end of all noble actions being eventually rewarded and all evil actions eventually punished. In other words, the just-world hypothesis is the tendency to attribute consequences to—or expect consequences as the result of—a universal force that restores moral balance. This belief generally implies the existence of cosmic justice, destiny, divine providence, desert, stability, or order, and has high potential to result in fallacy, especially when used to rationalize people's misfortune on the grounds that they ""deserve"" it. 

I usually recoil when I see a ""wall o' text"" post like this and you almost lost me by calling yourself a ""woke SJW"" but damn, dude, I hung on every word and read it all the way through.  And I'm glad I did.  VERY well done!

Privilege works in different ways too. 

I like a psychoanalytic approach, whereby the ego is invested in the ruling paradigm/Other (Lacan) and aspires to fulfil its desire. Stuff like Peterson plays on insecurities (due to social contradictions etc) and cognitive dissonance in this regard, and it can be a deep deep slide into its rationale. 

Even in my most bitter hours I still anchored my empathy. People who surrender themselves totally to fascism I can't speak for and have little desire to, but I think it's important to look at all the processes at work. Fans of Jordan Peterson are quite obsessive after all. Does privilege account solely for that?

I wish I had something more to contribute than how grateful I am to the men in this sub for their vulnerability and honesty. Thank you. 

I don't really understand my my male privilege. Like, I get my white privilege. Being white has made my life a lot easier. If I could chose my skin color at birth, I would pick ""white"". I get my born-rich privilege, being born rich has made my life a lot easier. If I could chose the socioeconomic status of my parents at birth, I would chose ""rich"". I get my seeing privilege, being able to see has made my life a lot easier. If I could chose to be blind at birth, I would prefer to be able to see.  

I don't get my male privilege. Being male has made my life easier in some ways. I don't get catcalled. There's lots and lots of other advantages. But there's also disadvantages. You can list advantages, and Jorden B and co. can list disadvantages, and the discussion doesn't go anywhere. How do I get to a synthesis? I feel like being born male hasn't made my life easier in total (but I might be wrong). If I could chose my gender at birth, I wouldn't chose ""male"" in an eyeblink. If you asked me right now, I would pick ""female"". At least, it wouldn't be an obvious choice. 

I would say an important factor in this regard might be the inability to capitalise on that privilege. No matter how privileged you are, if you are unhappy or unsatisfied with your life, you are not likely to admit you're privileged, simply because you don't feel you are.

I want to preface this by saying that I have read one of Jordan Peterson’s books and listened to him on a few podcasts. I’m not a Jordan Peterson fan per se but I believe that I have been exposed to his work enough in order to provide insight into why people like Jordan Peterson and what he offers that is both constructive and potentially destructive. 

I read his book Twelve Rules for Life and most of it was really about self accountability, responsibility, and meaning through sacrifice. Most, if not all, of the “rules” can be pretty helpful for people that are looking to get their life together in one way or another. None of it is revolutionary or particularly groundbreaking stuff though. In order to reach your goals in life you have to have the discipline to put off immediate pleasure for greater reward later. In an effort to try to change the world it is most constructive to start with the smallest and most immediate surroundings and work your way outward (this is where all the “clean your room” stuff comes from). Showing how accepting responsibility willingly and doing your best to meet that responsibility can be fulfilling. A lot of these concepts have been published in self help books before but for some reason this has resonated with young men. Specifically young men who are unhappy with where their lives are currently at or headed. A lot of his “rules” can help people develop a sense of purpose which is something that speaks to men in their 20’s. 

For people from this crowd, I don’t think it will resonate with anyone who’s life lacks meaning to hear how good they already have it regardless of how true that may be. If you are an individual of a privileged group and you still feel like you are seriously struggling then it can feel invalidating to be told that “people with the same skin color/gender/sexual preference as you are doing better on average so what are you complaining about?” I think the positive aspect of Peterson’s work is that it can help people who feel this way have an avenue that validates this feeling and possibly work on correcting it in a way that it is constructive. 

The more front facing aspect of Peterson’s career has been interacting with people in a more political manner. His career was basically launched due to his disagreement with a Canadian bill having to do with transgender people and preferred pronouns. He has debated with feminists on issues such as the wage gap and the amount of women in STEM fields. I think this is what has attracted a lot of people who just want to watch clips titled “Jordan Peterson absolutely wrecks feminist SJW”.

I think this is what brings out the lowest common denominator of Peterson fans. Especially on YouTube which can be a toxic place in and of itself. I absolutely do not agree with everything he says and there is also a fair bit of what he says that is misrepresented but I think that this side of his career appeals to people who just want to see “feminists get trolled”. 

Overall I think it is fairly nuanced. I don’t think you can classify people who like Jordan Peterson wholly as a group of incels any more than you could describe feminists as “social justice warriors”. 

All in all perspective is always positive. It is good to understand why Jordan Peterson fans feel the way that they do about him and what they’ve learned from him in a positive way. It’s also very important to understand why people who don’t like Peterson criticize him. 

P.S. I didn’t write this as a rebuttal to the original post but more of an explanation of why I feel he resonates with some people. I’m not necessarily trying to defend Jordan Peterson or his fans. If there are any specific things about stuff he has said or believes I can try to provide more insight if I can. He has talked about a ton of stuff so it can be hard to condense it down to a few paragraphs. Especially this late at night.

Good write up, You addressed your points fairly well without too much word salad 

The bit about how you’re unlikely to just throw out witty one liners and change someone’s mind was an excellent point, Reminds me of the guy who went around talking with Klan members and turning them from the Klan by connecting with them on an emotional level and bonding over mutual passions rather than slinging some witticisms 

My only real complaint is the assumption that his followers come from a place of privilege, plenty of his followers are the downtrodden and underprivileged because his rhetoric of meritocracy sounds fair to these people who feel society favours those of specific minorities over them based on perceived privilege

> The next time you see a friend who is a ""minority"", ask them about their  experiences with discrimination

Why the quotation marks?

>  Ask them about the things they've accomplished, and point out how those accomplishments could have gone differently if they didn't have their  privilege. 

Yes, if I was born with one hand, I probably wouldn't be making a living as a professional musician. Let's say that I agree that I have a privileged life (and compared to many people, I most certainly was very lucky to have been born the way I was) - I'm white, straight, male, in a rich capitalist country (by global standards), I'm from a rich family, I've been told that I'm talented, smart and good looking, I'm healthy, I have many friends and family, I do what I love for a living, and so on. What's your point? Is there anything I should be doing differently based on the fact that had I been born in a different scenario, my life would have been different?

&#x200B;

> Firstly, to say that power and competency are mutually exclusive within any system is like saying the fundamental basis of the structure of the universe isn't energy, it's matter. 

I stopped reading at the second sentence of your argument. Peterson did not ""say that power and competency are mutually exclusive"". He said ""the fundamental basis of that structure is not power, it's competence."" Only one thing can be the fundamental basis of something, but it can be linked to many other things.  


I'm not going to spend the time to read the rest of your essay if there's a logic error at the very beginning.  


If you feel like I'm misunderstanding you, please let me know.

This was a really great post/essay, thank you for writing it! 

Excellent information.I like the way of writing and presenting on  [checkered shirt](https://www.derbyjeanscommunity.com/product-category/shirts/shirts-checkered-shirt/)

I’m wondering what you mean by SJW, cause a lot of people use it really differently. For some people, it’s just anyone who cares about social causes, personally I take it to mean someone who gets overly offended on other people’s behalf, like the white knighting of activism. 

Personally, I am an activist, but I still get annoyed when people get extremely offended. It generally seems bad for the cause from my point of view. I am just wondering if you have any wisdom for me because you said you have gone through a phase that sounds simmilarish.

What would a circlejerk be without a discussion of circlejerking?

Jeez titrcj, you always seem to have relevant sauce for your comments in the reddit manosphere. We should combine our powers and become a megazord of effortposts.

Man, remember the manosphere's reaction to THAT?

Your comment about Reddit being assumed male until proven otherwise is one of my favorite parts about this site: there are no MySpace pics or demographic bios for us to fill out, unlike every other social media site. There are only your post history (rarely relevant, except when a polemic of leftist debate turns out to be between a /r/coontown user and a /r/jailbait mod) and your username (if you refuse to engage because I like pony porn too much, it’s not my fault you proved yourself too intellectually stunted to be worth any more of my debate). 

Other social media gets people making ad demographic comments based on the contents of the MySpace pic. Hell, even twitter furries like to put all kinds of information in their bios (age, gender, sexual orientation, whether their gender is still the same one they were given at birth, etc…)

This is the reason I’ve never made a female persona in an MMO, and I started playing them early. It was nice to, by default, be seen and interacted with as male. 

> I wonder if these men, like Jordan Peterson, have ever had to change or lie about fundamental aspects of themselves just to not be ignored. I wonder if any of them are truly capable of empathizing with people in situations different from their own. With people I know who follow Jordan Peterson and people like him they are able to empathize with me personally, but not a race or gender as a whole. It's like ""Yeah, you have a disability, but you work hard to better yourself so that means all disabled people can do that too!"" Except I couldn't go to college until I was 29. I didn't have a license untill 28, and I am still unable to have a year round job. They don't look at those as negative because they know me and how far I've come. But they don't know the other people with a similar disability to mine and don't know how hard ""bettering yourself"" can be. I've heard the argument that they have a black friend who doesn't care if they use the n word so no black people should care. It is very hard to see beyond yourself.

I think it's great that you have been able to do what the Internet ""set out"" to do, but worrying that you have to be thought of as a white man before being thought of as human.

These ""racial workshops"" sound super interesting! Are most of your clientele corporate entities that want workshops for employees?

My ironic language is popular with all the kids these days.

Definitely not. I didn't mean to sound reductionist in this essay. Every person is intersectional, and their worldview stems from many, many different influences. Privilege is just one small piece, although definitely an important one.

Yeah, exactly!

A couple things may help this. For the record, I am also a dude.

First, I want to make sure I validate the idea that you, indeed, have some disadvantages as a result of being a dude. If you didn't, there wouldn't be much point of menslib!

The things I always hear women talking about are *agency* and *safety*.

To the first one: one disadvantage you have as a dude is that you, on average, will serve a longer sentence than a woman for the same crime, just as a black or brown dude will serve longer than a white dude. 

This is good for women! Less culpability for bad choices, hooray!

This is *also* an example of how women are afforded less agency. We assume they're too weak, too dumb, like they acted out of *emotion*. Lack of agency manifests in many ways, too - at work, a woman can't be trusted with the big assignment, or she's not capable of leading a group of men.

With regard to *safety*: I don't think I have to tell you this, but women self-report high levels of sexual comments, degrading behavior, and overall creepiness of men towards them. Women are more likely to be seriously injured by their partners than men. Women are told to protect themselves from rapists, from creeps, from predators.

*This does not mean that men do not get assaulted.* Far from it - men are more likely to be victims of violent crime overall! The difference is that both men and women are victims *of men*, and men are *generally* better able to defend themselves against other men. 

This is just some basic stuff, feel free to ask questions.

An example of male privilege in my life: I'm a software developer. Every other developer on my team is also male. I've never had to worry about my knowledge or contributions being questioned or had to deal with people assuming I don't know what I'm talking about. If I wanted to find a new job, I could go on Indeed, pick a job posting at random, and (assuming I got an interview) it would be almost guaranteed that at least one - if not all - of my interviewers would also be male. Basically, the experiences of the male developer are assumed to be the norm. Some of these aspects of privilege are specific to my profession, but a lot of them extend to other professions as well.

Thanks for your thoughtful comment.  Since you offered to provide insight, maybe you can help me understand a couple things.  

1)  The whole thing of guys embracing and appreciating being told to stand up straight, clean their rooms, and get shit done...why do you think they are so grateful to be told this by Jordan Peterson when in all likelihood their parents and teachers have been telling them the same things for years?  I mean, it's not like this stuff is revolutionary.  It's very basic stuff that all of us have heard by the time we reach our late teens.  And yet I'm willing to bet most of these guys resent the same message from their mothers and view them as ""bitchy"" when asked to clean their rooms.  Why do you think that is?

2)  Peterson and a lot of his followers seem obviously misogynistic; this is much of the basis for criticisms against him, including those in this post.  And yet so often I see supporters of his who deny that misogyny or don't want to directly address it or seem very uncomfortable and immediately change the subject to the ""positive"" aspects of his messaging, the stand up straight/clean your room stuff.  As described by the OP, Peterson and his supporters believe white men are in charge because white men are superior, simply put; it's meritocracy.  And yet they get all squirrelly and evasive when put in a position where they have to directly cop to that.  Do you think that is because they just don't want the social criticism/arguments that goes with publicly declaring one's self to be a racist or sexist?  That inwardly they do believe in white male superiority but don't want to admit it?  Or do you think they don't see it?

Completely agree. Well said.

Privilege can be a lack of adversity because of your race. You can totally be poor and white and have shit luck. But,  chances are that under the same economic conditions as well as being black your luck will be even shittier, not to mention the higher likelyhood of being in that economic status to begin with.

>Is there anything I should be doing differently based on the fact that had I been born in a different scenario, my life would have been different?

Being here to ask this question is the first step. And it is such an important question.  


I believe the second step is educating yourself. [Working through some of these resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensLib/comments/3tn9kc/a_list_of_feminist_resources_tackling_mens_issues/). Letting them guide you to asking yourself questions about your assumptions and experiences. Some of them may be hard, but you will learn more about yourself even as you learn about the social constructions of gender and privilege.   


Third step is using this consciousness of your place of privilege as a lens through which to view the world, your own behavior, others' behavior and assumptions. To look at advertisements, pop culture, and the news and see the way rigid gender roles are created and perpetuated through mass messaging- and to reflect on what those in power stand to gain from encouraging the perpetuation of those gender roles. 

That's all internal work. Maybe you've already gone through those steps.  


Fourth step is activism. Having conversations about privilege with friends and family. Not preaching, but sharing things you've read or observed. Step up when you hear people close to you spout racism and sexism and homophobia. Vote for politicians who care about these issues. Find a community group to join or volunteer with - the local LGBT or Hispanic center, prison outreach, etc.   


I agree that usually when these discussions happen there's not much of an action plan to follow up the revelations.

Um did you read the next paragraph

> We consider ourselves a pro-feminist community.

Says so right on the tin.

As has been stated over and over again, by us mods, in our [glossary](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensLib/wiki/glossary#wiki_privilege), and by people in this very thread. **That is not what privilege means. It does not mean that you automatically have an easy life if you're white and nobody here is making that claim.**

There is absolutely no excuse for your ignorance at this point, if you are really here in good faith. In future, address what people have actually said, not what you vaguely imagine they probably think. As you clearly can't be bothered to read what anyone else has to say here, then you don't deserve to have your comments read by them either.

As before, literally nobody here is claiming that *all* white men have it better than *all* women of colour. The idea is that **all else being equal** you have some advantages due to your race/sex/orientation etc. I have explained this to people over and over again, despite it being stated in our glossary and multiple times in this thread.

I appreciate that your experience differs from most JP supporters, but you are still coming to this subreddit to attack something that nobody here believes. Are us mods supposed to keep repeating ourselves until we're blue in the mouths because people don't read our glossary or any of the rest of the discussion before commenting?

I believe I made clear in the essay that the utility of acknowledging privilege lies in the fact that encourages empathy with discrimination. The two are complimentary, not mutually exclusive. They are not the same either - acknowledging privilege requires a certain level of self-awareness that goes beyond simple empathy. 

I don't understand what you mean when you say ""privilege is a bunch of linguistic and statistical flim-flam"". It's a very specific cultural concept that is easily understood. Saying it's pointless as an idea because it's just the opposite of discrimination is like saying ""light"" is useless linguistically because we could just say ""lack of darkness"".

SJW is a term typically used by the right to discredit/devalue/disempower arguments or positions taken by the left, as evidenced by hardly anybody on the left referring to themselves as SJW (unless, of course, in opposition to the stigma surrounding the word in the first place), so whenever I use SJW, it's ironically/mockingly because it tends to conjure a very specific set of liberal values. 
Your perception of the term SJW is an effect of their rhetoric at work. It takes a hell of a lot to make me offended at something, so I would never seriously label myself as an SJW. But when I'm talking about my values and beliefs as the right might see them, even though they don't know me, would they call me an SJW? Almost certainly.
Similarly, I would never seriously refer to another left-leaning activist as an SJW, because I would be devaluing people that hold my own position, which, though I might think they get too offended over some issues, I would never use right-wing terminology to do so. 

I always think of SJWs as being people barely out of their teens who are very keen to talk *at* you about how society really works, because they've had their eyes opened by 6 months of university study on their \[insert social science field here\] course. They're absolutely determined to educate you (whether you want them to or not), because you just don't get it, and preventing you from getting your morning coffee/attending that lecture/buying disapproved-of item is far more useful than them actually putting themselves at any personal inconvenience by, for example, doing some socially useful work like volunteering for a charity.

TBH, I can see how that perons would be incredibly annoying, but it's such an extreme stereotype it probably applies to relatively few people.

I have zero care about how crazy right wing people call me, I half proudly but most sacastically call myself SJW, libtard, godless commie, etc.

I feel the same way.

Not meta enough? :'D

Something I've been preaching for a while is ""People can be disadvantaged in some areas of their life and yet be priviledged in other ones. Neither negates the other; you need help when you are disadvantaged; and priviledge makes it easier for you to benefit from situations (including getting help at times.)""

... lost somebody over preaching it at him though; he preferred believing that his disadvantage was structurally worse than those of other people.

One thing that's pretty funny IMO is that people we kick out of this subreddit for outspoken misogyny are often outraged, outraged, that we looked at their post histories - which is something you absolutely do have control over and reflects your values and personality, unlike your gender, sexual orientation or race. In an environment where literally all you can be judged on is what you say, people get angry when we judge them for that.

Is it even possible to like pony porn too much?

I actually get mistaken for a woman quite a bit on the internet

I remember when I made a female character on an MMO once. Soooo many creeps who would just not believe I was actually a guy and asking me for pics

~~Save us from this nonsense please. I'm a white man. The mod team is mostly white men. The US government is mostly white men. The most powerful person in the world is a white man.~~

~~Nobody is claiming white men aren't human. This sort of insincere clutching of imitation pearls is insulting to both of us. Stop it.~~

Edit: I am dumb.

So far we've run them in local non profits including afterschool youth programs (training the staff, not the kids) and our statewide coalition against domestic violence, as well as one open to any community members interested. In 2019 we're going to host workshops for the statewide dept of education and the state police. We're in the process of expanding our capacity but our focus is definitely on whole institutions as those tend to be the seat of systemic inequity and the ppl working in them tend not to realize their complicity

Yeah, it's hard to tell any more on reddit...not exactly an environment that fosters subtlety.  :)  

That's the problem with ego, empathy, recognition. It will read what it already believes and has experienced. i.e. I hate myself = this says I'm a piece of shit, and the ego tries to find a remedy. That's the root of a lot of those readings, I think, and an empathetic approach to dialogue has to factor that in dialectically. 

>This does not mean that men do not get assaulted. Far from it - men are more likely to be victims of violent crime overall! The difference is that both men and women are victims of men, and men are generally better able to defend themselves against other men.


I'm with you here but I would like to point out, as a man who was sexually assaulted by a girl as a boy and who has been struck repeatedly by women he was close with, that another part of patriarchy is downplaying women's harm. This is part of your first point but it does complicate the conversation a bit. 

I wouldn't even say it's completely due to culture, I think it's partly because lacking of consequence. As a shitty man if you treat other men shittily you risk getting beat up, you treat women shittily, less likely to get beat up.

Thanks for the response! I understand that stuff like catcalling are symptoms of much deeper problems that permeates our entire culture. But that’s true for mens issues as well, as far as I can see. I deeply wish that these problems would be solved. 

My issue is that I don’t understand my male privilege. Like, what does it mean that I have male privilege? What difference should it make? I feel like my white privilege gives me an obligation to support those who lack it, does my male privilege give me a similar obligation?

One thing to keep in mind with the violent assault thing is that violence takes different forms in different places.

I'm a short American woman and my partner is a very tall, very strong Australian man. He feels pretty comfortable walking around in public because, at least since reaching adulthood, he has been in a position to physically dominate the vast majority of would-be attackers.

But when we visit my home country, I have to remind him that violence doesn't work there the same way it works here. Guns are the great equalizer, and *nothing* about his size or strength can protect him. He is at least as likely to be held at gunpoint as I am, and probably moreso because I grew up in a rough neighborhood with a lot of gun violence and have an instinct for spotting and avoiding that type of risk. 

In any case, we *both* do feel safer here in Australia. It's just that his safety level is much higher than mine here. It doesn't help that all self-defense weapons are illegal where we live, even pepper spray. (Maybe this explains the relatively high rape rate in Australia, even though the overall violence rate is much lower? Basically, physical prowess is all you've got here, and this leaves women--who have *half* the upper body strength of men *after* correcting for size--at a distinct disadvantage.)

Why do you think there’s so little media coverage or societal attention of the glaring deficiencies in sentencing?  

The herculean force of will at work in software dev to level the playing field for women tells me with isn't really an issue, or will be gone pretty soon. Anything out of line basically gets taken to Twitter these days.

Regarding point one, the people you're talking about (parents, teachers etc.) generally use negative reinforcement. Basically they tell the boys to do x or esle they'll get angry/their grades suffer/they'll dish out punishment. That is not a good basis for a healthy view on life because it basically just teaches the boys to do the minimal amount of work to avoid negative consequences.

What Peterson promises is tangible positive reinforcement. If you do x, y and z you'll be more successful, you'll feel better and you'll get laid. Peterson is giving them something tangible to work towards through simple steps. For people who struggle with that, or who cannot even imagine working towards something because all they know is how to avoid negative consequences that is a very powerful message.

This is also the reason Peterson latches in on misogyny. The easiest way to give the people he's speaking to a taste of success is to teach them how to abuse the patriarchy and to make the most of their undeserved privilege.

[removed]

If you’re poor and white you’re still poor, you can’t just apply privilege on people who lack it just because of potentials 

Black people might have a higher percentage of poverty per person but the difference of effect between the two is negligible given they are both still poor and that’s going to be the largest influencer of their life 

Telling poor people their life isn’t suck because they are not a minority is why they support people like Peterson, you’re dismissing their experience of poverty because of the colour of their skin 

We should be addressing the core problems that affect everyone rather than favouring specific groups

It's been my experience that leftists will use the term ""idpol"" instead which is not nearly connotative and criticism of it isn't really mainstream in the left to begin with.

I definitely call myself an SJW, which really makes their heads spin and lets you start a conversation about how it's ok to unironically care about things.

Well, it *can* be structurally worse than other people, if you're a member of a group, face multiple forms of oppression or don't receive any help or sympathy for the problems you face.

Maybe a dick pic would stop them?  

No, my point is that it's disappointing that she is only able to be taken seriously when people see her as a (white) man - not that white men aren't seen as human. It should be enough that she has an avatar and that she's human - she shouldn't have to be seen as a man to be respected.

So I'll use another example.

When I was a teacher, there was sometimes nothing I would've prayed for more than a mother or female teacher to speak up when a mom ""corrected"" my teaching. Just something small - ""oh actually the kids loved it when he did that!"" As it was, I felt like I was *the boy teacher*, not just a competent individual in my own right.

Compare that to what women face in the workforce:

https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2016/10/25/how-a-white-house-womens-office-strategy-went-viral/?utm_term=.df1a481096ac

>Karen Tumulty had heard from a former Obama administration official that things were so tough for women to exert influence during the president’s first term that they devised a strategy called “amplification” to hammer across one another’s points during meetings. After one woman offered an idea, if it wasn’t acknowledged, another woman would repeat it and give her colleague credit for suggesting it.

This is just one thing you can do to make sure that women in your life and workplace are heard! This is you using what power you have to raise those around you. Repeat the idea and say *Mary was right, I totally agree with her.* 

There are a trillion tiny things like this! Ask women what they are. 

It's important to remember that you're not a bad person just for possessing privilege. Although it is a noble thing to strive for, you shouldn't feel guilted into helping anyone beyond basic human decency. Be aware of your privilege. Be kind and respectful (or at least equitably obnoxious) to everyone you meet. Vote for people you think can make a difference. Stay informed, and don't peddle crank theories or hateful rhetoric. Speak up when you see injustice. 

These are things all of us strive and struggle to accomplish, and we all fail sometimes. But as long as you're trying more often than not, you've already accomplished quite a bit.

Another answer: a lot of left wing people see massive oversentencing, particularly of black men, and think the female length sentences are better, so they are less talked about.

because men make up 75% of criminals and 92% of prisoners 

I think that's an overly rosy assessment. My cousin is in IT (not the same field as development exactly, but has a lot of the same issues) and she experiences the sort of things that my male privilege shields me from on a regular (weekly, if not daily) basis.

Interesting points to consider, thank you.

[removed]

I don't disagree with you totally.

I think the big difference between the Peterson's of the world and the ""SJW's"" is the acknowledgement of the underlying causes.

If society were to direct efforts towards economic status with a blind eye to race and ethnicity you'd see an improvement in everyone's lot in life. You would also presumably eliminate any reasoning for resentment of poor whites seeing their minority cohorts as ""having an advantage"".

Where this becomes problematic is that this doesn't address the underlying problems. We'd come right back to the fake meritocracy where we're all pretending that everyone is already being treated fairly and anyone who hasn't succeeded sucks personally.

I think the illusion is that we've achieved a society where people are judged purely on their merits. Where in reality we're still atoning and compensating for centuries of injustices. The travesty of people like Peterson is the assumption that we're already past the point where anything in our society has to change and that we've somehow gone to far to recompense.

To describe the ""offended"" leftists, you mean?

""What? You mean they're not ashamed of upholding their values even though their opposition gave them a silly name??""

It can be. In this particular case, however, when we discussed xenophobia and racism in Germany and the Netherlands (and implicit racism is very widespread in Europe, including *othering* people who were born into the respective country and only know its culture, just because their skin is darker), and his stance was that homophobia was worse because there's no widespread institutionalized racism in our countries. While we, that is I and several friends, tried to get across the idea that maybe these are two different things, that people can even suffer from both, that the impact of their similar experiences may weigh lighter or harder for some people, and that neither of these invalidate the other. Because somehow he tried to validate his own experiences of homophobia by invalidating other people's experiences with xenophobia or misogyny, and his own experiences of fat bullying using general ableism. )=

Oh shit, sorry. I completely misunderstood your comment. My mistake. I take it back.

I worry that men who do this will wind up making it seem like it's their idea, but it's a good idea in theory.

Black men make up a disproportionate number of criminals and convicts but we recognize that this isn't necessarily their fault and there is most likely an underlying cause, ie racism. But if we're talking about all men we don't, why is that?

Sure but I’m not sure why that would call for higher sentences for individuals or a lack of attention to the problem.

I mean yes and no, it has a different meaning. ""Idpol"" just means means ""identity politics"" - political focus on social issues for specific groups. Generally leftist spaces are open and inviting to that kind of conversation, and people in those places wouldn't criticize someone for getting offended.

I'd like to apologize to the mod team, it seems as though my recent submissions have been some gritty overtime for you guys.

Imma keep posting this shit, though.

Gender and race are much different axes of oppression 

we're talking about a small proportion of people. Also, these people are prisoners and criminals, which is society's Least Favorite Thing to talk about.

When's the last time you heard about prison slave labor fighting our fires, or prison overcrowding? Never, because they're not really people to us. 

Would you please stop promoting that transphobic asshat in this subreddit?

You broke the rules. Don't be an ass about it.

You're all right. It was a good post. If I'm going to be spending my evenings boiling lobsters, at least it was for something in depth.

So what? 

I kept up with the prison labor strikes and fully support them.  I think the blind eye we turn to prisons in this country (for both men and women) is unbelievably depressing.  

I do think we owe more to the men being overpunished.  If you took an intersectional approach I’d be willing to bet that it is mostly poor and minority men that face the brunt of this discrepancy.  We literally ruin lives with overzealous sentencing.  

I know you didn't mean it, but that's the best pun I've seen all week.

Comparing two things that are not the same and asking why they aren't the same is kind of silly. 

We do. Some of this is politicians terrified to look ""soft on crime"". Some of it is the fact that no one cares.

Why are they not similar?

Being a police offices invilves very stressful and on the spot thinking, and I can agree that sometimes they make the wrong choice, but most of the time police offices are forced to shoot a suspect not because they are scared (althought that may be a factor) but because the suspect is acting suspicious

If BLM movement really cared about black lives they would try to convince those who kill the majority of young black men, other young black men.  If you can’t even convince your own community of your self worth, then there’s no point or hope preaching it to everyone else.   It’s not the white people, Hispanics, Asians or even the cops who are killing over 80% of young black men,  it’s other young black men.  And when the cops see this happening in these black  communities, of course they’re going to be a little tense and cautious whenever they approach what looks to be the prime killer of young black men.

No you're mistaken. haven't you been paying attention? cops are deeply racist and they actively hunt out black people to arrest and shoot. they ignore the white people in the rich neighborhoods even though they commit crimes in equal levels. haven't you been to a rich neighborhood? there are crackheads in all the alleyways and people pushing heroin in the parks.

I personally don’t think that cops should be able to make the decision to shoot someone unless they are 99.99% sure they are in danger.

I get that they’re scared of being shot, but I don’t want to get shot either.  And I can’t just go around shooting anyone that puts their hands in their pockets or is holding something I think has the most remote possibility of being a gun.

I am not a huge fan of police officers, but my emotions aren’t really terribly relevant to this subject, & for all involved have served only to obfuscate & misdirect attention away from responsible actors.

Ok, I’m not saying that to question the bravery of Cops, I mean just that. If you believe Someone is about to pull out a powerful high-capacity killing machine, that calls into action a human response. Other places, like I believe in Sweden, where rifle training is Available from the government, doesn’t have a Mall Of America of different gun /bullet retailers and the plethora of dangerous options available in America.

So if a cop is responding to a call in Sweden they usually don’t have to consider their lives ending. So they don’t shoot people.

Well-heroin pushers also Drive Mercedes Benz. But that disparity is not in the cops hands to sort.

You are absolutely wrong and have no facts to back up your claims. 

I have been shot and it hurts like hell the fear of hearing a gun go off echos in my kind a lot and because of obvious reasons you dont want to be shot 

Of course, but they know the statistics, they know a)what the people who are most likely to kill them look like. 

B) the rate that American cops are killed is 100% greater than many other developed countries.

Those two unfortunate realities lead to some of the outcomes we are seeing. You’re right. But cops are not a line of code, they’re humans.

I see where you are coming from, but in reality legal gun owners in the US commit less crimes than cops, so ot is usually the ones with illegal guns that pose a threat, and I agree that the government, if possible, should try and stop illegal guns from being sold instead of regulating more guns, becaise by adding more regualtions on legal gun owners they are targeting the wrong people

I dont understand what you mean by sorting

This is what all of america believes. if you have proof the other way around you are the one who has the burden, not me

Science has answers to America’s mass shooting / gun violence problem. Social science is science. But for some reason Americans don’t like science very much. 

I mean, jailing meth addicts while simultaneously as a society, giving kindergarteners amphetamines, doesn’t make any sense, but that kind of policy change is the work of politicians, not police.

Beliefs are not proof. 

Again most of thise are commited with guns obtained legally, and 60% of felons avoided committing crimes if they knew the target was armed. In the UK 59% of burgularies are “hot burgularies” because you are not allowed ro hvae a butter knife, but in the US burgularies are only 13% “hot”, because gun laws are more lenient. It is the peoples right to protect themselves, and they do that. According to the CDC about 500000 to 3 million lives are saved because of guns (the gap is pretty big because some statistics include just waving around a gun and not actually firing it), also most felons are shot by other felons

Alt account? 

be that as it may. black lives matter should make police training better so that they stop shooting innocent people of whom 30 percent are black.

well what do you believe? and then what is your proof?

I don’t believe it would be appropriate to prevent gun ownership totally in America. But there are a lot of limits & changes that could be made to guns / ammo / training / design /safety / certainly culture -while still avoiding that.

i missed that. hilarious what a weird thing to do. is he trolling me?

There is no scientific way to quantify inherent racism in cops, nor is there a way to quantify that there are crackheads in rich white alleyways and heroin users in rich white parks.

Because you cannot prove what you say, your remark is patently false. 



Can you please tell me what changes you are suggesting, because that was kind of vauge. Thanks :)

Yes.

No.

if there is no way to quantify something, it is unproven. therefore you are also false too

I’m not a policy maker or a gun designer! / pschylogist etc. I won’t repeat gun-control advocates talking points, tho I don’t disagree w them- one thing I think would make a significant difference is if an extensive gun safety and shooting instruction was more engrained into any possible gun owners first gun purchase. A license, of sorts. I think that is more reasonable than a lot of other proposals like reading people’s fucking instant messages on Facebook! 

That isn't how this works. 

There are a lot of backgroung checks done, and tbh it is not as easy as just walking in and buying a gun, thats why mist gun crimes are commited with illegal guns

This is the internet. could you realize there are thousands of people watching and stop trying to argue with some idiot and use this as the perfect time to prove to me and everyone who upvoted me that what I said is patently absurd?

Aye I thought you meant that- you said legal guns. I didn’t propose that as the one fix, just something - like maybe if George Zimmerman had physically practiced engaging physically w someone while firing a warning shot- like when are the moments when lives can be saved? There might not even be a black lives matter if it weren’t for that case.

You mean the one person (other than yourself) that upvoted you? Are you serious? 

I agree. Police should be trained, but we cant blame them all the time when they are put in difficult situations, sometimes they make bad decisions and are punished for that but other times they are just following their training. And in many stressful situations firing a warning shot towards the suspect or “just shooting them in the leg” is not that easy although I do agree that George was wrong in his actions

I always downvote my own comments. you haven't contributed to the thread. you are only arguing with *me*. the correct thing to do would be to list statistics that show what rate white people get shot at and crime statistics for other races. but you're just having a met argument about how arguments should work. nobody cares about your bullshit. we want proof and you can't offer it can you?

I'm arguing with you *because* you are arguing *beliefs* as facts. You said this yourself.

You can't prove or disprove that cops are racist. You can't prove or disprove that there are crackheads in alleys in rich white neighborhoods. You can't prove that there are heroin users in rich white parks.

I don't expect to have a rational debate with someone who posits a belief over a fact. 

You're acting like my assertions are unfalsifiable. that isn't true. one could look in alleyways and parks in rich neighborhoods and see that there are obviously no crackheads and heroin users. and you could look at the cops and see that they aren't racist and they shoot white people at higher rates than black people, it just isn't being reported on the news because that doesn't fit the narrative that sells the most adspace.

Started out as a peaceful movment to protest violence against blacks but barley focused on the real matter at hand which is black on black and increasing gang violence in black community,they mainly focused on violent criminals and how because they are black they dindu nothin,  it then spiraled out of control thanks to today's ignorant generation into a domestic terrorist group and ever since then people stopped caring really. So all in all blm is a huge joke now since it was taken over by racists

The issue is that black folks experience police brutality at a much, much higer rate and due to unique reasons. And it's at a point where you have to wonder if, we really give a shit if people think that black lives matter

Well basically you know how you get angry when someone does something but then when you do the thing you don’t get mad but still think everyone else is a dick. That’s BlM 

Have you heard the dinner table metaphor? Everyone sits down and gets a meal except one person, we'll call him Timmy. Timmy says ""I'm hungry I need food"" and everyone else at the table responds with ""Timmy we're all hungry and need food"". They might be right but that doesn't do anything to solve the problem.

[deleted]

**black lives matter** basically means black lives matter **too.**

Black Lives Matter as much as White Lives.

This should be true, but isn't. Put differently, all lives mattering is empirically false.

If one believes police misconduct disproportionately impacts people of color and marginalized folk, you agree with the core message of BLM.

Yes. All lives matter.

""Black lives"" is a subset of ""All lives"".

I see no problem.

Coplivesdontmatter 

Bingo. 

Are those “unique reasons” committing more crimes? 

Yes I’ve heard this. But I’ve never understood it
Because this is the way I see it.



4 people sit at a table 


White people get three quarters of a slice of bread 

Muslims get one half of a slice of bread

Latinos get one quarter of a slice of bread 

Blacks get one eighth of a slice of bread 


Now it is very clear that the blacks got the least, and whites got the most. But ultimately, everyone is going hungry. Blacks may be the hungriest, but everyone is starving in that situation. Nobody is winning.

So instead of the blacks saying “I’m
Hungry” and everyone else saying “we are all hungry” 

In my mind What the blacks need to do is go to the Latinos and say “hey, if I am just one voice saying I am
Hungry, then I won’t get very far. But if we join forces and both say we are hungry maybe we can have a bigger impact.”

Then the blacks and Latinos need to recruit the Muslims and the whites and march themselves to the store and demand more food. 

In my mind is just seems more of an American issue than a black issue. And the more that blacks separate themselves the more difficult it is becoming to have actual change. 

Because instead of BLM becoming a positive movement to change an American issue, it has become a back and forth amount racists and liberals. I think if they would have started the movement with a message of “we have a police brutality issue that is effecting the black community, as well as the Latino community, and is especially prevalent among the poor, we need to address these issues for the sake of everyone’s freedom and rights”


But instead went with a message of “we are the only ones who suffer any kind of injustice in this system and we demand attention for this injustice” which I think rubbed a lot of people the wrong way. 

I will say it again, black people have it the worst. That really really sucks and I want to help out however I can, but I also want them to know that I too have personally been affected by police brutality. That I have family that have been victims of police violence and that we need to stand TOGETHER and fight for EVERYONES right to not be harassed by police. 



but I also think I am biased in that i came from a poor neighborhood that was almost entirely Latino. My wife and her family are Latino and the issues that the Latino community face are awful. And I absolutely hate seeing all suffering of the people in my neighborhood get lost in the shadow of BLM. 






Lmfao people actually believe this shit

Well this I wouldn’t object to. 

They should have used #blacklivesalsomatter and I would have stood behind that 100%. 

I think what really bothered me about the whole thing was how exclusive it felt. 

My father is white, but been brutalized by cops a couple of times. This was because he is a poor white, with a drug problem. 

I myself have been held at gun point twice by police officers going up. I was also tackled and given a busted lip and black eye from a police officer when I was 13 years old. I wouldn’t necessarily considered that brutality, but it was excessive and surely it’s evidence that our police could use some better training. It’s a pretty wide spread issue across every race, and everyone deserves representation in that.

I certainly wouldn’t agree with that. Police lives also matter. Our police are put in very dangerous situations, they do deserve a level of respect and their lives do matter. Now obviously we can use better training in our police forces, and we can try harder to remove the racist, classiest way that many precincts operate. We also need to get rid of the “them vs us” attitude that seems to be wide spread.  

Ah... that moment where I'm not sure whether you're being satirical or genuine...

Structural issues like bad neighborhoods due to redlining, failing schools and minority stress. 

> It’s a pretty wide spread issue across every race, and everyone deserves representation in that.

Because of things like this, there is currently an attitude in society that black lives *don't* matter. It would never be worded like that, but that's the result of this shit. So saying that black lives matter is an assertion that there *is* a belief they don't (as much), and that it's wrong.

BLM wasn't started to do discredit you or your brother's experiences but to share theirs. If you had a movement to protect homeless people from the cops it would be a good cause but it shouldn't just be in response to black people doing it because that just looks to discredit what has happened to them. 

I think this is where my confusion comes from.  I know that black people are jailed far more than whites people. Now I am a firm believer that many of that can be attributed to the systematic racism that left the black community in poverty. (IE. redlining) 

This I am aware of and sympathetic towards. I know that often times white people have more money, which means better defense and often times lighter or no sentences. 

I know that being from poverty causes cycles of poverty. 

I know that the black community is still to this day trying to recover from many of the systematically racist policies of the past that have left them generations behind in education and Wealth. 

And I believe this is mostly what causes the higher numbers in brutality. killings and imprisonments against blacks. There are obviously other reasons, but this is a big factor. 


So yes black people are killed at a higher rate, BUT from my perspective (growing up as a poor white kid, whose both parents were criminals). 

Everyone in my neighborhood was afraid of the police, my stomach STILL drops when I hear a firm knock at the door. I’m married into a Latino family that is absolutely terrified of the police and The amount of Latinos that we’re killed in my neighborhood is absolutely disgusting, and so when #blacklivesmatter came up it made me furious because of the things I’ve witnessed and experienced growing up. Having gone through the experiences it felt completely exclusive of everyone else who also deals with these issues. 


But I’m not arguing with you, I do agree that black lives matter. But at the same time we need to not think that the black community are the only ones dealing with this issue. They may have the worst of it, but they are not alone, we can’t forget about everyone else. 

No one is suggesting that we forget about anyone else. And BLM doesn't mean that you didn't have it bad.

The problem is that there are a lot of people who *do not* agree that black people face extensive problems due to racism. Spreading awareness is crucial to changing the perspective of people who think that the only black people who suffer at the hands of law enforcement must ""deserve"" it.

I'm not black. But I am able to listen to the problems of black people without perceiving them as a threat to my own. They aren't. They're still real and often denied.

As for the subject, black people are erasing America history. It's a bit misleading. I don't actually believe they are, but I think they are making white people assumed for being, well, white. Let me try to explain: Black people are portraying, particularly in BlackLivesMatter movements, that all white people are not oppressed. Yes, there were the 60s and the Jim Crow era where literally black people were evicted from their homes for being black. And I can of course understand the angry and hatred that caused their families to be torn apart because of the War on Drugs, and how to be told to give up their sit for the whites. I can definitely understand. 

My point is it was not me telling them to give up their for me, and the truth is I don't how would or even *we* would act during those times. Politically correct, I would hope I would not act that way towards anyone. But political correctness has always been an oxymoron. I guess what I am trying to say Change is needed, but we don't have to treat ever white person like a racist asshole because he (I am specifically talking about white males) doesn't share a similar view.

And i say to you good sir, your horrendous grammar is erasing american discourse.

There are tangible things you can do to demonstrate non-racist views, but saying ""not all white men"" isn't one of them.

You might enjoy r/menslib

black people don't do crap.

 They are just a tool that different political factions use against each other...and they are caught up in the middle of it and do not have the political finesse to ever be anything more than a tool.


you are seriously missing the mark if you think the problem is black people. You are looking in the correct direction...but you need to wipe that smoke from your eyes and see who the real problem was. 

Especially when I write on a crappy Galaxy phone lol 

Could you enlighten me with a  article or a book title so I can understand yout point of view, please? 

Clearly Samsung is the problem here. If only more idiots had Appl... wait, never mind :(

look at this...from 1928: https://www.marxists.org/history/usa/parties/cpusa/1928/nomonth/0000-pepper-negroproblems.pdf

'john pepper' was actually born Jozsef Schwartz. He felt the need to change his name...as many eastern European jews did because the communist party in eastern Europe was a bit too visibly jewish...so these people wanted to adopt 'gentile' sounding names.


The iconic leader of the civil rights movement...martin luther king...was actually just a communist puppet and his speeches were written by Stanley levison….an American communist jew who also defended the rosenbergs when they sold nuclear secrets to the USSR.

it is communist jews...not blacks...who recognize the importance of destroying the traditions and the history of a people (and their religion, the 'opium of the masses') in order to essentially tear them down and then hopefully rebuild them as more pliable citizens.

It is necessary for any tyrannical regime to separate the citizens from their own history...to separate them from each other...so that they are alone and without conviction and easier to control.

black people are just a useful tool. They are a natural proletariat...they are easy to brainwash...they are violent and dangerous. If you want to wage war on the white gentile, it is an obvious tactic to weaponize the black man against them.

Hollywood, which is mainly run by communist jews, loves to produce movies about how mean the white man is to the black man. It saturates our modern culture. That narrative is made omnipresent by the communist jew...and they love to invent new language to describe the ways that white people are mean to black people...privilege, white fragility, etc etc. The jewish-run media loves to spread basic bitch lies about how white cops are going around randomly killing black people for being black.

All of this is crap that black people never would have thought on their own without jews talking about it all the time. If a black person was to simply think about their own experience with white people and forgetting all the bullshit they have heard from the media...they would have to admit that it has not been so bad for them.

 But instead you see black people hungry for a second civil rights' movement...and when the rubber hits the road and you hear them complain about whatever terrible injustice they think they suffered in their personal life...you cannot help but notice that this crap is as trivial as the stupid feminists. 'some white person assumed I could not afford an overpriced purse'....so fucking what?


shall I, a white person, instead mention the inconvenience of living around black people? the level of crime I experience? the level of hostility? the fact I cant even complain about it without becoming unemployable? I could make a list of grievances that would make the indignant black activist blush...if they had any ability to swallow their own pride. (but of course, they don't...they are fully under the control of their masters)


but I have a broader perspective. I don't blame the black man for his dysfunction. I see the guy behind the curtain pulling the strings. Its the fucking jews, bro.

No-one has implied that white people have ""traits"" that make a difference. The problem is that some white people gained wealth through slave labor and have built on and passed that benefit down to their children.

The only way race plays into this is that it was white people who thought (and still think) that this was OK.

This is a purely leftist reddit sub for leftists ""memes"". Humor is objective here for them. Only political correct ideas and ""jokes"" are allowed: Hopefully from a mainstream sanctioned late-night TV show.

This is not ""vanilla"" internet where people banter and joke about. You've stepped into an entrenched one-sided political propaganda machine. Just head back to the normal part of the internet where people can banter without being chastised for not following their hardened borderline-fundamentalist party line.

Imagine being as butthurt as these comments

Well most of that is true although idk if you could attribute that to any sort of racial superiority especially given that non white groups like Asians and Jews on average do better than their white counterparts even in predominantly white nations. That's not even all of it either as when it comes to physical traits especially conserning athleticism white people are typically outdone by their black counterparts. Plus if we're being fair Europeans were lucky that Europe is their homeland as had they started off in the Americas for example then its unlikely that they'd have made the same sort of progress that they did in Europe

Black people invented the cotton gin, which revolutionized the farming industry. Black women were involved in the mathematical process to even make space ships fly. Do you not think black people were involved in advancing civilization, or just threw shit at each other until the 1960s?

FFS, you originally argued it wasn't a pun.


Sure, ***technically*** it is. I woodn't say a badly constructed stool isn't a chair. Or poop for that matter.

### St. Clair County in Illinois has a [long history](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2005/01/the-big-picture-east-st-louis-voter-fraud/) of confirmed cases of voter fraud.

### One St. Clair official Kelvin Ellis was also [sentenced for attempting to arrange the murder](https://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2006/02/no-more-plotting-murder-pimping-vote.html) of a witness to the county’s rigged voting system.

In 2015 Belleville, Illinois resident Peggy Hubbard [posted an epic rant](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2015/08/must-see-epic-rant-by-black-belleville-woman-on-wednesdays-blacklivesmatter-riots-video/) on the police shooting of young black man in North St. Louis.

Peggy compared the black community’s reaction to the shooting of Mansur Ball-Bey in North St. Louis outside a crack house with the shooting death of 9 year-old Jamyla Bolden in Ferguson. Jamyla was shot dead while studying on her bed. Peggy was outraged the liberal media made more out of the crackhead’s murder than that of the little girl. Peggy was [called](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2015/08/st-louis-area-woman-criticizes-violent-race-mob-is-called-white-mans-bed-wench-video/) an Uncle Tom, Aunt Jemima, the White Man’s Bed Wench, and the White Man’s Black B*tch for speaking her mind.

on Tuesday Peggy volunteered as a poll watcher in St. Clair County. Peggy later tweeted out that she caught drunks, dementia patients and voters who did not reside in the city attempting to vote on election day.

**Peggy stopped it.**

I witnessed attempted voter fraud on Tuesday.

92 yr old woman with dementia who could not speak

A man with 2 drives licenses and 4 different addresses

A woman that didn't live in the city she was voting in. And, Democrats were going to let them all VOTE!

I stopped it….

I even had a man SO drunk he forgot his name. You could smell him from 7 feet away. And, they were going to let him vote.

Unreal what Democrats would allow.

Important  official legal disclaimer: This is a short work of fiction.  Any  resemblances to real people (including myself); people you may know;  people you think you may know; etc.; is entirely deliberate.

When I’m at work I’m staring at a screen.  When I’m not at work I’m  staring at screens.  Checking social media.  Scrolling through updates.   Scrolling through friends.  Scrolling through #instagram.  Scrolling  through #amazon.  The customer is always right.  Make sure the product  you’re selling is something that people want to buy.  

On the subway we’re surrounded by people that we don’t know and never  will.  Our heads are tilted down, eyes connected to smartphones and pod  devices.  Playing free games. Bright lights and colorful shapes.  Swipe  swipe swipe.  Group texts. #netflix.  Fantasy football updates.   #snapchats.  The anxiety of being human.  New Yorkers avoid looking at  or talking to one another.  Once in a while there will be a crazy person  on the train and all of us normal passengers can smile at each other  and sigh.  At least we’re not crazy.  

The subway tunnels are the arteries and veins of the city, the  passageways of the busy hive.  If you close your eyes the movement  through the tunnels feels organic, alive.  A buzz of worker bees on our  way.  Where are we going?

I don’t want be a part of the hive.  But I’m a human being.  I need other human beings.  

Something is broken in me.  I hate myself.  I don’t feel connection  in any aspect of my life.  friendships, family, romance, work.  Ennui  and alienation are my reality.  A city of 8 million people.  A hive of  loneliness.  

My life is no tragedy.  I don’t have any real reasons to be sad but  I’m sad.  I wasn’t abused.  My parents love me.  I went to college.  I  had all the benefits of a middle class upbringing.  I’m a white male in a  society that has persecuted anyone and everyone who isn’t. 

I eat mostly fast food.  Chinese delivery.  #mcdonalds.  #kraft  macaroni & cheese.  #dominos.  Microwave dinners.  High sodium.   High Fructose Corn Syrup.  MSG.  Intense flavors.  Addictive flavors.  

There was a terrorist attack and the nation was in shock.  A maniac  with a gun shot up a shopping mall.  The president offered his  condolences.  We had an all-staff call at work to discuss how we felt.   It’s important for us to remember that terrorists are evil.  When  terrible things happen on our TV screens it’s important to show  solidarity.  

We’ve never had an all-staff call at work to discuss our solidarity  with the homeless people that we walk by each day between the subway  station and our office.  The woman who stands by the subway entrance  shaking her cup of change every day.  The couple that sleep in sleeping  bags each night under the awning of the bodega.  We didn’t have an  all-staff call to discuss our solidarity with our co-workers who were  laid off last week.   

Binge.  Binge-watch.  Binge-watch television. The revolution will be televised.  The revolution will be tweeted.

# ThisIsUs#Freshofftheboat#Blackish#Blacklivesmatter#Change#Makeamericagreatagain#Strongertogether#Target

Browsing the internet, searching for a date.  Swiping through  thousands of profiles.  The deep human need for connection.  ""Love to  travel"".  ""Looking for a partner in crime"".  “Enjoys witty banter”.   Attempting to send thoughtful messages that will stand out.  Being  ignored.  Rejected.  Every once in a while a rare response.  Variable  rewards.  You’ll never win if you don’t play the game.  Dopamine. Slot  machines.  Addiction. 

Sometimes I wonder if people have genuine friendships anymore.   Sometimes I think back to the times when I had friends.  My friends from  college.  I think I was always a little bit sad underneath it all.  But  friends are a good medicine.  

We had a lot of fun back in college.  This was back before our jobs  dragged us to all different corners of the country.  Nowadays we talk  about the #nfl or #GoT through group texts.  Sometimes we wish each  other happy birthday.  Usually we forget.

Breaking news.  Check your smart phone.  Turn on your television.   President Trump did this.  President Trump did that.  Terrorist attack.   Hurricane. Polar Ice Caps melting.  Destruction.  Human beings are  terrible to each other.  Stay informed.  Stay alert.  Informed citizens  watch the news.  Check #bbc, #cnn, #msnbc.  Get updates and  notifications.  Twitter and social media keep us informed.  Smart phones  are smart.

Drugs make me feel better.  Temporarily.  Porn works too.  Weed.  A  little coke. A little molly.  Drugs and porn don't really make me happy,  but they at least make me not sad for a while.  A quick bump to take  the pain away.

Everyone is an addict.  Addiction is good for the economy.  Some  addictions are respectable.  Some not so much.  work, shopping, smart  phones, #facebook, television, fossil fuels, #marvel super-hero movies,  #mcdonalds, #instagram, pornography, #dominos, coffee, alcohol,  #snapchat, cocaine, #oxycontin, heroin.  The economy is doing well.

I talked to my sister a few weeks ago, she lives in Colorado.  She  used to live in Arizona, and before that North Carolina.  I miss my  sister.  Like most young people she goes wherever her or her boyfriend  can find work.  She complained about her job, about how all her  coworkers seem so fake.  No one really seems to care about what they’re  doing.  It’s more important to make it seem like you care than it is to  actually care.  

The other day I saw a picture she posted with her co-workers - “So  happy to work with these great people and this awesome company  #workfriends”. 

The global economy is great.  Even as it rips apart the connections  that we need for our emotional health, it comes up with ever more  products and services and gadgets for us to substitute for those  connections and soothe our loneliness.  One day we will all be starting  at screens all the time and we’ll never have to interact with humans in  the real world ever again.  Life will be good.

I know some people who find meaning in their work.  They work long  hours.  They go out drinking with co-workers.  Mostly they work in  advertising or tech or finance.  These industries are important because  they help our economy grow.  Growing the economy is important.  We may  live on a finite planet, but we’re committed to an economy that can grow  forever. 

An economy is not the only type of organic system that can commit to a  cycle of endless growth.  Sometimes it happens with cells in the human  body for instance.  This is called cancer. 

Most of my time at work I sit at my desk pretending to work hard.   Wondering what the other cubicle bees are doing with their time as they  pretend to be working hard.  Sometimes I do spread sheets that people  tell me are useful.  Measuring.  Counting.  

Once in a while I’ll grab lunch at the bodega or at #mcdonalds and  I’ll notice how the employees there work so much harder than I do.  Most  of them are bi-lingual.  They probably work harder in an hour than I do  in a day.  

I sit at a desk in front of a computer, so my job is really important.

Smart phone.  Smart TV.  Smart car.  Smart house.  We are smart.

When I get out of work I walk to the subway with all the other worker  bees leaving their jobs.  The sidewalks are buzzing with people heading  this way and that.  It’s important to walk fast to wherever it is  you’re going.  It’s important to go where you’re going and for everyone  else to go where they’re going.  Thinking about where you’re going is  time wasted when you could be getting to where you’re going.  Be careful  if you smile at other people, they may see it as a threat.  

At rush hour there is always a man on the corner near the subway with  a sign that says “Jesus Loves You.”  His eyes are intense.  He doesn’t  seem to be in a rush to get anywhere.

I love to learn.  I love to read.  I mostly hated school.  Some of  the most intelligent, interesting, and creative people I knew were  dropouts.  

School was useful for teaching us that life is about measurement and  performance and specialization and commodification.  Your peers are your  competition.  Things like empathy and imagination and cooperation are  hard to measure.  They’re non-linear.  School doesn’t like them.

Prison population is something we can measure.  There are more black  men in prison today than there were enslaved at the time the Civil War  began.  There are 2.3 million Americans in Prison.  America is the home  of the Free and the Brave.

There was a pretty young woman at the register at the bookstore.  She  told me that she was a huge fan of the Nabokov stories I was buying.   Said she loved the way he plays with language and meaning.  She reached  to give me a bag for the book and I told her I didn't really need one.   She apologized and smiled and said that she must have asked me about a  bag already.  I told her that she hadn't.   She blushed.  I asked her  her name.  I asked her for her number.

Later I sent her a message.  Maybe I could take her out for a drink  sometime.  Smiley face emoji.  I never got a response.  Connecting with  people is hard.

Social media.  Social.  Media.  We are social.  We connect with our  screens.  Social media connects us to what is important.  Likes,  upvotes, retweets, friend requests, updates, notifications.  That  friendly buzzzzzz from your smart phone.  It feels good to be social.   Dopamine.  Remember - Your brand matters.  Everyone is watching.

Technology makes the world better.  Technology solves problems,  especially problems created by other technology.  If new technologies  create problems, the solution is to develop newer technologies to solve  those problems.  Technology and progress are the same thing.  Technology  helps the economy grow.  When technology makes human beings obsolete,  that is progress.

Sometimes it seems that we relate to our machines better than we relate to each other.

One in sixty-eight children in America is diagnosed with autism.   Autism is characterized by impaired social interaction, impaired verbal  and non-verbal communication, and restricted and repetitive behavior.

I feel like my job isn’t actually about doing anything.  Success is  really about making it look like what you do is important.  Lying to  yourself to tell yourself that what you do is important. 

Teamwork and cooperation are actively discouraged at work.  No one  knows what anyone else does, but supposedly what everyone does is  important.  Stare into your computer screen.  Do we live in a world  where success is about manipulating our fellow human beings?  #winning

One day after work I saw an old woman on the subway with a young girl  sleeping at her side.  The woman was sewing a scarf.  Sometimes people  are good to each other.  Sometimes the small things in life can be  incredibly beautiful.  Once in a while happiness will come when I’m not  searching for it.

I wish I had a girlfriend.  Someone I could talk to without feeling like I’m lying to myself.  

People around me are growing up.  Getting married.  Having kids.  Settling into life.  My conscience is at war with my culture.

One day I took a train out of the city.  I took some molly.  I was  hoping to escape the traps of language.  I needed nature.  I needed art.   I was looking for something that wasn’t for sale.

Our culture destroys connection.  Alienation is endemic to the  system.  Nobody knows anybody, nobody knows themselves.  We blame and  ridicule anyone who reflects the fear that is hidden within ourselves.   Those who are suffering the most – the poor, the homeless, the drug  addicts, the crazy, the uneducated.  Anyone with a political ideology  different from our own.  Organic human interaction doesn’t exist, all  that matters is your ability to sell and your ability to consume.  Smile  for #instagram, smile for #facebook.  Image is everything.  Human  beings are commodities.  We stare into screens, selling ourselves to  each other.  We desperately hang on for a sense of meaning and purpose  to a culture which is destroying the ecosystems that we depend on for  life.  A culture which transforms our deep emotional need for meaning  and connection into a deep emotional need for products.  

In 2015 there were 33,000 deaths in America from heroin and  prescription opioids.  These drugs are pain killers.  Pain.  Killers.   What pain are we trying to kill?  

Some of the best people I know are chronic drug users, some of them  functional, some of them not so much.  What does it mean to be a human  being?

Once I got so lonely that I was no longer myself.  I was the hive.   The people moving to and fro, the traffic, the ambulances, the delivery  boys on their bicycles, the junkies, the couples hand in hand on the  sidewalks, the children and dogs playing in the park, the street  festivals, the subway cars rumbling through their tunnels.  It was all  me.

The sounds of the city are music.  Everything is frequency.  It’s buzzing.

Rather than acknowledging and sharing our pain and fear, using  vulnerability to connect, we project onto each other.  We revert to  tribalism.  Tribalism and hatred increase when our communities are our  screens.  Morality and empathy function differently in this environment.   There is only the tribe and the Other.  The safe space and the enemy.   Stronger Together.  I’m With Her.  Make America Great Again.   #BackLivesMatter  #BlueLivesMatter  Advertising is our culture.  #hastag  your tribe.

I miss my sister.  I miss my whole family.  Including my extended  family that I don’t really know.  Sometimes I think that humans aren’t  really supposed to behave like bees in a hive and that we are actually  designed to live close to our families and our friends and work close to  where we live.  Maybe work and life and culture and happiness aren’t  supposed to be separate things.  “Commute” is a silly word.  There’s a  hope somewhere deep down that we actually need each other…that people  are worth it.

As a straight, college educated, white male, I sometimes feel that  I’m not allowed to be upset about the world we live in, I’m not allowed  to be hurt by it.  I need to #checkmyprivilege.  Maybe I just need more  drugs.

It’s important for us to be living in a state of constant  consumption.  After all, what are we if we’re not consumers?  What does  it mean to be a human being?  

Sex sells.  Sex is a good product.  Orgasms can be counted.  How many  people have you fucked?  I don’t know how to have a genuinely  vulnerable emotional connection with another human being.  What happens  after the orgasm?  Connecting with someone who you hope to have an  intimate and beautiful relationship with is about selling yourself.   Always remember:  You Are A PRODUCT.  

Make sure you have a great profile pic.  It’s important to start out  with a clever user name.  Never start with your real name.  This is  advertising, people don’t want to know the real you.  Make sure you look  sexy at all times.  Ugliness doesn’t sell.  Swipe your way to  happiness.  True love is a click away.  Everyone’s there.   An entire  city.  A busy hive.  

Drugs are Good drugs when society says they’re Good drugs.  Good drugs are legal, Bad drugs are illegal.  

Good people Hate president Trump.  It’s important to have socially  acceptable outlets for channeling negative emotions when living in an  oppressive culture.  Ridiculing and making fun of Trump and his  supporters is something we can all do together and share in the fun.  

Is it possible that Trump supporters might be human beings too?  Is  it possible that hatred is just fear and pain turned outward? 

How’s your social media presence?  What does it mean to have  “presence”?  where am I when I have #presence?  Presence; noun; The  state or fact of being present; current existence or occurrence.  

Science and technology allow us to track and influence the behavior  of massive numbers of human beings.  The entire hive.  How does the  swarm function?  

Humans can be tracked by consumption habits and behavior predicted  and influenced using algorithms.  The more data there is the more  accurate the predictions.  Eventually feedback loops from past behavior  can be used to influence future behavior.  What we consume tells us who  we are and who we will be.  #hashtag it.  Humans are just numbers after  all.  Numbers that can be measured, counted, commodified.    

Tech and big data are amazing.  It’s really great they way the tech  industry helps our economy.  Why judge people by the content of their  character when there are statistics and algorithms?  More products to  help the economy grow.  What does it mean to be a human being?

After the Civil War, the former slaves were free to make their way in  this home of the Free and the Brave.  In Florida and other parts of the  south, during the reconstruction period, it was common for freed slaves  to be thrown in jail for no other reason than the fact that they didn’t  have work.  Once there, they were forced into chain gangs to build  railroads and other infrastructure projects.  Many of them died due to  terrible conditions and over-work.  Railroads were important because  they brought industry and technology and economic growth.  Economic  progress makes the world better. 

Every once in a while the screens get turned off.  I get the rare  chance to talk with friends or co-workers away from the screens and  outside of the office environment and I have the impression that they  are genuinely interested in having a positive impact in the world and in  their community.  Why do I feel so alienated at work, and in life?  Why  are we so disconnected in a world of constant connection?  It has  something to do with the system, the wider culture.  Culture is  powerful. 

Worker bees working, the rhythms of the hive.    

A beautiful fall day in Central Park.  An oasis amidst the concrete.   The wind blows through the trees, leaves shimmering in the sun.   Fractals.  The individual elements reflect structural patterns of the  whole.  

A beehive is an amazing thing.  We can’t understand the hive by  looking at the behavior of an individual bee, yet the combined behavior  of the bees create a new phenomenon that is more than the sum of its  parts – the hive.  Swarming is like a cultural phenomenon of the hive.   It is a pattern of the hive reflected in the bees.

The heroin addict reflects our culture of addiction.  The cancer  patient reflects our pathological attachment to endless growth.  The  autistic child reflects a society in which we have lost the ability to  empathize, lost the ability to feel.  We relate more to machines than to  each other and to the earth.  A black man murdered in the street  reflects a culture in which human life is a just a number.  Humans are  products.  A salesman for president is a reflection of us.  It shows us  who we are.  

The art of the deal.  President.  Salesman. Don’t forget that you’re for sale.  Everyone’s watching.  

I don’t have a single person that I feel I can talk to about things  that matter to me.  I don’t have a single relationship where I feel I  can be comfortable being myself, where I feel understood.  Attempts that  I make to connect are met with rejection.  I fail over and over and  over again.  The relationships I do have are superficial.  Why am I so  broken?  Sometimes I think that I might have something positive to  offer.

The personalities that thrive in the modern world are those that  embody the traits of psychopathy.  Rapid turnover in interpersonal  relationships.  Lack of any real need for a sense of community or place.   Focus on the superficial and image based forms of communication as  opposed to depth and nuance.  Lack of empathy.  Commoditized,  fragmented, specialized and depersonalized interactions with others and  with the planet.  We are all engulfed in this culture.  There aren’t any  good guys or bad guys.  Causality is non-linear.  We’re all guilty.  We  are a society in which the ability to consume is our highest virtue and  being poor is a moral failure.  Poor people hate themselves and each  other for being poor and worship rich people for being rich.  Rich  people hate themselves just as much as poor people, if not more so.  Can  you ever consume enough to create an identity?  What does it mean to be  a human being?  Technology, screens and financial capital.  Fossil  fuels.  Endless War.  Drone Strikes.  150 to 200 of the species that  make up the biosphere of planet earth go extinct every single day.  2,220,300 people incarcerated in the United States of America.  Home of  the Free and the Brave. 

Does the bee comprehend the nature of the hive?  There are 7.442  billion human beings on planet earth.  The individual human brain does  not work with those kinds of numbers.  We can’t relate to 7,442,000,000.   7,442,000,000 are not faces that we know.  7,442,000,000 is not  connected to place.  The way we make sense of 7,442,000,000…is as a  product.  A product to be exploited and used for all that it’s worth and  then discarded a long with the rest of the natural world.  Success in  our culture, in the industrial juggernaut that we call our economy,  comes from the ability to manipulate the largest number of human beings,  from figuring out and implementing the most efficient ways of turning  human beings and the planet into a #commodity.

This is some low effort and low quality b8 

bozo

I'm not a Nazi, a Neo-Nazi, or anything close to being racist. However, I am a white male and still plan on voting Republican.

Frankly, the term ""fascism"" and ""fascist"" is thrown around very loosely by people that truly don't understand the term, much like yourself.

You sound like a moron

Upvoted, I love a good bait

So being a conservative makes you a racist/homophobe and a nazi?

Weak bait.

I wasn't sure if this was bait or not, but those hashtags at the end convinced me that it is.   

Edit: I just checked his post history, and he posted here 3 days ago ""There is nothing wrong with being Anti-Semetic."" Yeah, he's just a bratty 15 year old who doesn't get enough attention from his parents. 


I am republican and none of those things. 

lol you sound like a big ole faggot

u/Torque74 Back at it again with the aggressive baiting. Jeez man. I understand riling people up for kicks and giggles can be fun, but all the time? Go hang out with your friends or go hiking or something man. Get some fresh air.

The nazis were great when it comes to family denunciation, just saying!. 

To be honest, this sort of reads like one of those T_D posters posing as a ""liberal"" in the most extreme way possible so as to dupe some liberals into thinking they are serious.



Like the opinion, but this is terribly written. Consider obtaining a brain.

it's crazy how reddit is allowing racists and russian bots 

i know it plenty, look at how much the media pushes fascism and completely censors liberals it's getting out of hand. Look at reddit, ran by white supremacists pushing a radical far right agenda

When you associate with racists, you cannot be angry when you are considered a racist.

reddit is also full of russian bots.

Oh look another russian bot

its bait.

conservative nazi... is there a difference these days?

why do people keep saying bait? I' horrified a whats' going on

if you're a repubican then you yes, you are a nazi

who cares if I was? I guess you are jus a conservative who hates fags

hey man i just want to bring america back out of fascist rule. i mean fuck i was a CHEESemAKER  but me and my wife had to sell EVERTYING to buy guns and get training. they WILL NEVER take my faggot mexican neighbors. I WAS A FUCKING CHEESEMAKER and now i'm thrown into some awful hitler remake

2/10 b8 

you obviously dont know what fascist rule is

free speech is free speech but you just cant fix stupid

Which media? CNN and MSNBC are admittedly *very* Liberal, and still very loud. [MSNBC and CNN are still very popular.](https://www.adweek.com/tvnewser/here-are-the-top-cable-channels/361102)

It's a loose term used by Liberals for a rise. The truth is, the economy is better than it's been in a long time, my paycheck has increased due to tax changes, unemployment is low and jobs are being created.

If that's the truth, why would you join such a site?

It's also chock full of NPCs

Hello Mr. NPC #3518

Being conservative does not make you a homophobe or a Nazi or a white supremacist or racist any more than being liberal makes you an overly sensitive delicate cunt.

Because it sounds incredibly stupid 

You’re an idiot 

I’m very pro-Jewish. Does that still mean I’m a Nazi?

The truth is, racism isn't a deal breaker for you.

it's the only place i can spread the truth to people

wut

Ummm, i watch CNN, MSNPC, ABC and all the others ( except fox, they are racist) and are you telling me that all those places are wrong? Thought so

Like i have time to grammar check, we are under fascist rule

no i'm just an american who doesn't like o see fascism

You are lying

stop the hate

as my grandfather would say, ""your bread isn't done""

Are you insinuating Trump is a racist?

You are not being taken seriously, especially posting in /r/unpopularopinion.

Oh, I get it now... You’re just trolling... My bad, carry on

I wasn’t talking about your grammar, but your message.

Who does? I see no fascism anywhere in my America

Ask me whatever you want. 

Are you insinuating that he isn't?

i have no where else to post in a site that censors liberals and promotes white supremacy

no

so you agree

YOUR AMEriCA? This is what i'm taking about, your time is coming to an end racist

will you help me strip whites of rights?

You can't make the claim and not prove it. Prove that he's a racist.

Lol the majority of subs on this site do NOT censor liberal opinions, nor do they promote white supremacy.

You're not being censored because of your political affiliation. You are being censored because you have no sources or facts to backup your ridiculous claims. In other words, you're just a damn troll.

Damn! Reddit censors liberals? Must've never been to r/politics and the plethora of other subs that disparage non-extreme conservative opinions 

You have to be, those news organizations have never classified conservatives as a whole as racists/nazis/homophobes. You’re making shit up

What did I say that was racist?

LOL, if you honestly do not think he is racist after every thing he has said and done, then I wonder if you even understand racism..

You can google ""Is donald trump racist"" and see links to dozens if not hundreds of articles.

As I said originally, racism just is not a deal breaker for you.

what world do you live in? every time i post about how all white people need to have rights taken away, i get BANNED, if that isn't promoting white supremacy, i don't know what is

sources? Um life has a liberal bias so no sources are needed if you have a brain or eyes

/r/politics is ran by white supremacists. anytime i bring up trying to plan for white getting their rights taken away. i get a warning but plenty of upvotes. obviously the people agree but the nazi mods are promoting white supremacy

everything

Again, prove it. If you don't have proof, that's fine, but no one can take you seriously.

Oh so you're a troll. Carry on.

You are being banned for calling for violence against those who oppose you ideologically. You can't take someone's rights without force. You're a fucking coward and advocate for the government to do the dirty work you're too chickenshit to do your goddamn self

[You insinuated that CNN is run by ""right wing radical white nazis"".](https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/9tm6nz/if_you_dont_call_out_your_conservativerepublican/e8xb8l2/)

Prove it.

You're calling for violence against your ideological opponents, that's why you're banned

Lol you hate nothing. 

You’re a fear mongering globalist.

I see you. 

You do not google it because YOU DO NOT WANT TO KNOW.

You wanna pretend, that's fine, but do not get mad when we call you and trump a racist, because that's how it's looking.

no, what makes you think that

I would do it my self but theres too many white people. I don't want them tortured just have their rights taken away as they are the problem for this world, they do nothing but harm. I would know, i'm a white person, i always have racist thoughts of harm on minorities but i supress those feelings by taking high amounts of estrogen. I'm an ally of the minorities and they whites need to go

how about watch it once if you care even a little bi

what do you mean? most people agree white peole are the problem

wtf? i'm dressing, stop looking

I have Googled it. It's just a bunch of CNN articles claiming he's racist. Again, **you made the claim**. Prove it.

>every time i post about how all white people need to have rights taken away, i get BANNED

Do you not understand that one must use violence to strip people of their rights? That gives those people the right to use violence to defend their rights.

Now you are lying and so we are done.

There is no fucking way that is all you saw.  Its not remotely plausible.  

Just because no one calls Trump on his lies do not think you can do the same thing and no one will call you on it.

If you googled it, you saw something like this:

https://imgur.com/1iozErR


This is proof that you are a liar right? 



ridiculous, even most white people agree that they are the problem. without white people we'd be colonizing wakanda

of course teh whites will use violence back, it's all they know

The first two links are CNN articles, twerp.

The third and fourth, Independent {Liberal] articles, with 'racist dog-whistle' quoted as they're sourcing it from another Liberal media.

Fifth, Wikipedia that can be edited and altered by anyone. 

Sixth, Snopes, which is simply stating he's been accused of it before.

Lastly, The [Liberal] Washington Post, claiming, much like [Liberal] CNN, that Trump is a racist.

Again, there is **nothing** via a Google search that is **proof** that he's a racist. I'll be damned if I'm listening to Liberal Washington Post, MSNBC, or CNN.

...you do know Wakanda is a fictional place, right?

You need to wean yourself off the teat of the liberal media, man.

They are also pretty good at it too, be careful what you wish for

Now, after I have to SHOW that you are a fucking liar, NOW you wanna explain shit?

No anyone cannot alter that wiki article, you are a fucking liar again.

If anyone can alter it, then go and alter it RIGHT NOW and make it say ""DAEGOG IS FULL OF SHIT""

If you cannot do this, that makes it TWICE you are a fucking liar.

You MAGA nerds are so utterly full of shit, there is no reason to even talk to you.

Fictional? Wakanda? That's where my cousin was born

we have white guilt on our side, the ultimate weapon

You are attempting to change the subject because **you cannot prove Trump is a racist**. But, [I'll oblige in the fact that you *can* edit Wikipedia, even as shown on their website.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Editing)

>Wikipedia is a wiki, meaning that anyone can edit any unprotected page and improve articles immediately for all readers. You do not need to register to do this.

Blacklivesmatter does the same thing. 

Police brutality is a myth plain and simple. Yes there are bad cops, just as there are bad black people. The minority should not be used to represent the majority and both groups mentioned should be well aware of that. 

Instead they continue to spew hate and fear amongst the public. People who are unintelligent and easily coerced hang on to every word they say. And that is why we see the resentment and hostility towards cops today. There is no denying that guys like SK and BLM deeply influenced the actions of Micah Xavier Johnson, who in 2016 killed many people in retaliation of what he perceived was police brutality. 

Lastly SK and BLM do not care about justice. They only care to light the fire and hate in the hearts of the masses. They use our race to do this. They are no different than internet trolls attempting to incite violence. 

If you want justice you must acknowledge the entirety of the facts and truth. Not just what you want because you have an agenda to fill. Most of the people SK and BLM idolize were killed by accident or resisting arrest. Some were even armed felons.

307,Jokerang,"The reactionary claim of ""Dems are still the party of racism/the KKK/the Confederacy"" is among the most damaging of right wing revisionist lies because it seeks to rewrite the history of liberalism being the dominant force for Civil Rights in America.",131,9s6ah0,https://www.reddit.com/r/centerleftpolitics/comments/9s6ah0/the_reactionary_claim_of_dems_are_still_the_party/,8,2018-10-29 12:10:08,"Anyone who's studied American history can tell pretty easily that liberalism has been the main force for civil rights in the country, while conservatism, due to it's nature of trying to maintain the status quo, has often been opposed to it. We see this in the present, where American conservatives are generally against BlackLivesMatter and LGBT rights, while American liberals are generally for those causes.

Obviously, admitting to being on the wrong side of history is tantamount to political suicide. So in the wake of the Southern Strategy, the cons have been engaged in some serious historical revisionism. A school of right wing ""historians"" and ""academics"" has sprung up, which for political reasons is hellbent on rewriting the story of the Civil Rights movement in particular and race relations in America in general. They are the intellectual equivalent of the participants of the Unite the Right rally. 

Among the most prominent of these revisionists is Dinesh D'Souza, who makes ""documentaries"" about how the Democratic Party is the most racist organization on earth and how Hillary Clinton is evil incarnate. Alongside such figures as Charlie Kirk and Jonah Goldberg, he has been consistently spreading the idea that the Democrats, being the party of racism from 1850-1960, are still racists today, in much more sinister and hidden forms.

Some of his ""conclusions"" are as follows:

* Lincoln was a political conservative

* the 3/5 compromise in the original Constitution was, in fact, a move in favor of the rights of African Americans

* LBJ was racist, even after signing the Civil Rights Act into law

* the welfare state is a ""new plantation"" that Democrats use to ""keep"" African Americans in line

* racism died in the 1960s, and any who bring up so-called ""injustices"" against blacks today are really closet racists looking to charm blacks into voting for them

Such obvious lies and falsehoods have been happily accepted by national conservative figures like Trump and Ted Cruz, eager to shed the racist past of American conservatism in favor of something more pleasing to their ears.

**In spite** of Lincoln waging war against the South against states rights to preserve the power of the federal government-

**In spite** of the South, bastion of segregationism, being solid conservative GOP territory today-

**In spite** of the modern GOP and American conservatism barely hiding white nationalist dogwhistles

**In spite** of African American voters overwhelmingly changing their votes from Republican to Democrat after the Civil Rights Act-

**In spite** of LBJ signing the Civil Rights Act-

**In spite** of Barry Goldwater, GOP nominee for president in 64, running on a campaign of opposition to the Civil Rights Act-

**In spite** of public knowledge of the Southern Strategy

**In spite** of Trump's shockingly racist policies-

*the revisionists still loudly proclaim that conservatism has been falsely accused, liberalism is racist, and that African American voters don't know what's best for them.*

Sadly, these lies have found fertile ground in a political ideology that knows the reality of a post-Civil Rights movement, and will probably take a generation or two to be removed from the political mainstream for good. ",">Claims To Be “The Party of Lincoln”

Feminism started before women had a right to vote- so I mean it definitely was about equality at that point. Men literally had more rights than women, and feminist were the ones who fought for those equal rights. 

Today, women and men receive pretty much equal treatment at a legislative level (everyone can vote), but there are still some social issues that disproportionately effect women (ie. birth control, abortion, sexual violence) and modern feminist are typically the ones who fight for the interests of women on those issues. 

Completely agree.

Though I would also say, look into Black Lives Matters; they're basically just a re-branding of the Black Panthers with added righteous indignation and at their core they're little more than a domestic terrorist group who go around smashing up property and calling anyone who objects racist. 

By all means fight against racism, I live in a country that's more than 85% white anyway, so I don't see racism. If anything the closest I get to racism is the frankly disgusting racism we get here from Indian/Pakistani people directed at white people. They make up about 7% of the population and they are extreme insular communities that actively and unapologetically treat white people as inferior while using the race card to claim everyone else is racist towards them whenever they don't get their own way. We have about 3% black people here. I've legit only ever met two black people and one of them was an insane SJW who basically imported her politics from USA and screamed about being oppressed non-stop.... it's like I said to her, ""I don't hate you because you're black, I hate you because you're an insufferable cunt and that would be true if you where black, white, blue, green, or day-glow fucking orange"".

Feminism is about making WOMEN equal to men, not just equality. It doesn't really care about making men equal, just women.

OP needs to learn instead of announcing that they are ignorant sexists. 
An unpopular opinion should be an opinion, not just a denial of facts/definitions.

[deleted]

[removed]

There are pros and cons to either sex, but feminists only focus on the downside and don't mention the tremendous power and privilege you get for being a (reasonable attractive) female. You are generally treated well socially even if you are shy and not very outgoing. 

Can't forget about wages! ""Follow the money"" 

Claims of racism are mostly a tool to get what you want these days.

[deleted]

> it's just for women, and I'm pretty sure that when the movement started the intend was never to at any point maybe help men and fight for men's rights when they have less than women in some cases.

Of course they don't fight for men's rights. 

It's called *feminism* because they are a *women's* advocacy group. That's literally the whole point. Their goal is to advance the interests of *women* so that their voices and opinions are held in equal regard as those of men- just like the NAACP's goal is to advance the interests of People of Color, so that their voices and opinions are held in equal regard to those of White People.  

For example, Roe v Wade (legalization of abortion) was considered a massive *feminist* issue. Feminists were focused on *women's* right to choose what they do with their body. 

Feminists fight for equality *for women*, not for everybody. That doesn't mean that they don't *want* equality for everybody- it just means that they are choosing to focus their energy issues of equality that effect women.

I mean yeah, obviously feminists are going to focus primarily on the things that negatively effect women. They're an advocacy group. The whole point is to focus on what still needs to be addressed, not what has already been accomplished.

Okay let me try to explain my reasoning in a different way. 

---

Let's say Sarah (women) has $5 and Bob (men) has $10. 

Option A (what you are saying): Treat them equally. Give both Bob and Sarah $5. You are supporting them equally, but now Sarah has $10 and Bob has $15. Even though you are supporting them equally, Bob still has more money. 

Option B (what I am saying): Focus attention on Sarah. Give Sarah $5. You are only supporting a specific group, but the result is equality. Now Sarah and Bob both have $10.

>  it's not like there's something like ""limited resources"" in politics and you could only change like 10 laws a year.

But there are. 

It takes a *ton* of time, money, and manpower to push things through our legal system. That's why you don't see laws constantly changing, and that is why you see *billions of dollars* being funneled into super-pacs and lobbyist groups.

That is why special interest groups exist at all. That's why the NAACP exists. That's why AARP exists. That is why the NRA exists. These are groups of marginalized or under-represented people who are fighting for their voice to be heard at an equal volume as the people who hold most of the power. 

The NAACP does not fight for the rights of white people, because even though white people might be marginalized in some specific situations- they are focusing their attention on a *specific goal*, because that is what it takes to change policy in America. If you trying to help *everybody*, then you spread your resources too thin and end up helping nobody.

> Ok, I'll give you that, but my original point that things like saying they're fighting for ""equality"" or even ""equal rights for everybody"" are just not true and it's pretty ignorant of them

This is the first definition of feminism I could find on Google:

""the advocacy of **women's rights** on the basis of the equality of the sexes.""

So yes, their focus is on ""equality of the sexes""- but the implication is that the reason for inequality between the sexes is that men currently hold the majority of the power. 

So it is true that feminist are fighting for ""equal rights for everyone""- but they are doing that by focusing on supporting *women*, because *women* are the ones who are at a greater disadvantage right now. 

Just like the NAACP is fighting for ""equal rights"" by focusing on a specific group (black people) who are at a greater disadvantage. 

It doesn't mean these organizations are ""lying"" when they say they are ""fighting for equality"". It just means they are fighting for equality in a specific, targeted way. 



[deleted]

The goal is to reach equality by strengthening women's rights. That is and always has been the goal of Feminism, and they haven't tried to hide that. 

Feminism has always been about focusing on women. It's literally in the name. I'm not sure why you would expect otherwise? 

Expecting Feminists not to focus on women is like expecting the NAACP not to focus on people of color. 



[deleted]

> because in a world where, in some cases, females are already privileged above men you can't reach equality by only strengthening womens rights

Okay I think this is the root of our issue.

If you believe that men and women are equally privileged, or that women somehow have *more* privilege- then yeah I could understand why you would think that feminism is wrong to pursue the interest of women. 

But I think this is the wrong way to look at things. I think women are *very clearly* still disadvantaged in our society. 

Yes, woman now have all of the *legal* rights of men, but there is still a *cultural* stigma against them. 

For centuries, our culture assumed that women were inferior to men. It's only been in the last generation or so that people have started to think differently. It takes a long time (sometimes longer than one generation) for culture to shift it's perspective. 

I think that's why you don't see as many female politicians. I feel like that is why you don't see as many female CEOs. I feel like that's why you don't see as many female media executives. It's not even *close*.

Are women *allowed* to have these roles? Yes. Absolutely. They are legally allowed to have these jobs. But they still mostly do not. Why? 

Well there are two basic explanations. 

1) Women are biologically inferior for these jobs. Women make worse leaders due to their genetics. 

If this is the case- then feminists are wrong. There is no point to trying to advance the interest of women, because they will always be less qualified than men. They should just give up and accept that men and women will never be equals. 

I personally think this explanation is wrong- and that's evidenced by the fact that we *do* see *some* women who are clearly extremely qualified to do the same work as men. There are already a handful of women CEOs and Politicians who are doing great work- so it seems unlikely that women are worse at those jobs just because they're women. 

**OR**

2) Sexism is still part of our culture, even though it's not part of our law. Women are generally not taken as seriously for positions of power. 

This is the philosophy that feminists are opperating under. They believe that the reason there are not more women in power is not because women are ""inferior' or ""not meant to be leaders""- but because we have been trained to *think* those things for centuries. Now they are trying shift that culture towards one that treats women equally *culturally*, not just legally. 



[deleted]

But how could you demonstrate that feminism's goal is anything else? All of the dictionary definitions and mission statements of their officially recognized organizations say that their goal is equality. 

The only people calling for actual ""Female Superiority"" are far-left extremist and SJWs- which I will admit, do exist in small pockets-  but those don't represent ""Feminism"" any more than the openly racist tiki-torch guys marching in Charleston represent ""Conservatives"". They are using the term to advance their own agenda- but that's not the agenda of that is widely understood as official. 

[deleted]

> at this point where women and men have mostly equal rights

But there are still issues that disproportionately effect women (birth control, reproductive rights, sanitary product taxation, ect.) that need to be fought for and defended. 

> Feminism presents itself as a movement that tries to achieve perfect equality, but that's not the goal, they're only fighting for women's equality and acting like that'd mean the same thing.

I think that is a misrepresentation of how they present themselves.

They've always been fighting for women's rights and equality. That's the point. They are not actively fighting for anybody else's rights and equality. They only focus on women by definition. 

The NAACP fights for black people's rights and equality. The NRA fights for gun owner's rights and equality. ARRP fights for the elderly's right's and equality. Feminism fights for women's rights and equality.

White supremacists are in all faucets of American society. This is how they maintain White privilege at the expense of POC Americans while simultaneously playing divide and conquer to maintain a rift. Voter suppression in the South is STILL a thing in 2018. Ask African American, Asian American, and Hispanic voters there.

What utter shite. How, when all you see and hear is far left propaganda spewing out of the news, corporations, and colleges in USA, can you say it’s a white supremacist society? There’s no logic there, if anything, it’s the opposite way around on present course, then we’ll be right back to square one.

The irony in saying it’s white people playing divide and conquer is so strong it’s actually funny. How many times does a white person verified on Twitter tweet out ‘I hate black people’, or ‘hands off my culture’ or something to that affect. Now how many times does an asian person or a black person tweet out ‘I hate white people’, or ‘you’re appropriating my black/Asian culture’. Your arguments don’t stand up to reason.

Far left propaganda? Calm down with the conspiracies and control that anger buddy. Reddit is full of White nationalists posing as other races to create division, gaslight experiences, and play divide and conquer among POC Americans. Notice how over 95% of all racist incidents caught/recorded on video are always of a White perpetrator against a non-White person? Very telling. 

You tell me to calm down with conspiracies whilst posing that lots of the non-white people are secretly neo-nazis. Dude. What the fuck? 

Also, are you just going to ignore everything I’ve said because it doesn’t fit your narrative?

And to your last point, it’s such a fallacy. You’re arguing from a position of authority where you shouldn’t be. The racist incidents YOU see online are all white>non. The ones I’ve seen tend to vary, and are ultimately irrelevant anyway. There will always be racist pieces of shit, whether white, black, green, or fucking purple.

Just because they seem irrelevant to you doesn’t negate that Eurocentrism has a huge influence on why 95% of racist incidents caught on video are always of a White perpetrator whether the victim is Black, Hispanic, Asian, Arab, or Native. Same common denominator each time where Eurocentrism takes hold.

Again you’ve completely ignored what I said. Show me the complete list of racist incidents caught on camera, and I’ll concede 95% are white>non, if that’s even the case, which I highly doubt. Your argument is a bit... off.

No that’s just you reaching because you’re not liking what you hear. Type in YouTube “racist caught on camera” and you have your evidence.

You clearly don’t understand the difference between statistical and anecdotal evidence. You’ve claimed 95% of racist incidents caught on camera are white>non, which you can’t prove. Finding one incident on google won’t change that. I’m tired of this useless circular argument. This is the problem with your nonsensical identity politics, it will never get anywhere.

You clearly are upset as you assume one does not know the difference between statistical and anecdotal evidence as a means to appease your fragility to what you don’t like to hear. YouTube > type racist road rage. In fact, just type racist and see what the perps are. It’s always a White male (sometimes female) racially harassing a Black, Asian, or Hispanic citizen. Quit getting so emotional and succumbing to your own fragility.

I’m not getting emotional. Your attempting to deflect on to others as a group seems like an argument from emotion if ever I’ve heard one.

To address your point. Yes, people say nasty things when they’re upset. When people get angry on the road they will let the worst of them show. Not saying it’s right, it isn’t, but there is some grounds for explanation. It’s certainly not proof of anything statistically concrete regarding racial attacks or insults.

I mean let’s apply logic and a bit of emotional intelligence here. Firstly, how do you know what’s uploaded to social is a stratified sample of all racial attacks? There’s no law stating that it must be. Maybe white people don’t record the attacks against them, because they either have the capacity to dismiss it or just don’t care. Maybe there’s some, quote: ‘fragility’ at play here that means black, Asian, whatever people must record everything that happens to them so they can use it as a vague justification for their own racism (see: redefining racism to conveniently exclude themselves from it so everything racist they do is all okay)

Lol you’re clearly upset and getting more emotional. Relax as this is just an online forum. Also, you misused “deflect” and I’m sure you meant to use project. 

No there are no grounds for explanation when it comes to racism. Video evidence of people hurling racial epithets and engaging in racial harassment is concrete evidence of racism. It’s amusing how far and high you are attempting to reach to justify and essentially defend the behavior. 

“I mean let’s apply logic and a bit of emotional intelligence here.” - Clearly those 2 distinct concepts are contraindicated for you regarding the realities of racism in America. Interesting that a White British male is attempting to dictate what is or isn’t racism within American society. 

“Maybe white people don’t record the attacks against them, because they either have the capacity to dismiss it or just don’t care.” - I like how you treat Whites as a monolith yet essentially imply the opposite about others who are on the receiving end of racism from Whites (as evidenced by the plethora of video recordings of racism against POC). POC use technology to their advantage to document what they’ve been experiencing for decades within American society. Keep reaching though. That inner fragility to realities of POC really has you scraping all around to justify by all means necessary what POC endure. Lmao.

I’m not upset at all, I’m enjoying the discussion. A bit circular, but I’m enjoying it nonetheless. Firstly, my nationality of ethnicity is of no relevance to this. I’m as entitled to comment on what I’ve seen and understand as anyone else.

“Justify and essentially defend”. No. I clearly said it’s wrong. Now you’re trying to poison the well. I’m simply saying road rage brings out the worst in us. That’s it.

“Regarding the realities of racism in America”. So not believing in a victim class or something to that affect means I don’t think logically or have any emotional intelligence? I’d argue that I’ve taken the logical stance throughout. Exemplified by my point about the stratified sample which you conveniently neglected to comment on.

“Treat whites as a monolith”. Not at all what I’m doing. In fact I think you’ll find that’s what you’re doing. You’re right, you’re definitely projecting. I’m treating everyone as an equal. There’s no oppressed class, everyone is an individual. Some people are cunts. That’s literally my position.

“Plethora or video recordings”. Let the record show this is a recurring circular argument that has been countered on numerous occasions.

“Experiencing for decades”. Maybe before the 60s yeah. We’re in 2018 dude. How much more do you want the deck stacked in the favour of specific racial classes? Is it when white people are at the bottom? Is this all about retribution for the sins of the father? Do I need to cleanse myself at thine holy alter?

Your defensive essays point to another truth but sure whatever you say. You are absolutely entitled to comment however it seems your reading comprehension is entirely subpar as I stated it was amusing that a White British male is dictating the realities of POC in America. Another reach though not surprising at this point nonetheless.

“Now you’re trying to poison the well. I’m simply saying road rage brings out the worst in us. That’s it.” - As I stated, there is no excuse for racism. You can have road rage without being a racist as non-racist individuals do all the time. If you resort to racism, you are a racist. Period.

“So not believing in a victim class or something to that affect means I don’t think logically or have any emotional intelligence?” - No you reaching in all directions to justify the pure incidents of racism countless amounts of people have recorded on video for clear evidence signifies the lack of logic and emotional intelligence. Believing in a victim class? How laughable and irrelevant to the discussion at hand.

“Not at all what I’m doing.”- That is precisely what you’re doing. “Maybe white people don’t record the attacks against them, because they either have the capacity to dismiss it or just don’t care.” As opposed to POC is precisely what is implied based on the conversation at hand. This is comical at this point. I’m stating the realities of POC (not sure how many times that needs to be stated).

“There’s no oppressed class, everyone is an individual.” - Everyone is an individual but not treated equally in a society where Eurocentrism has plagued the intricacies and dynamics of society.

“Let the record show that this is a recurring circular argument that has been countered on numerous occasions.” - Actually you have not countered it whatsoever but deflect from the discussion to appease your personal fragility to what was said because you don’t like what you hear. No need to distort facts and realities to appease that specific fragility. The evidence is all over the internet thanks to people who will not stand for racism and intend to expose it. 

“Maybe before the 60s yeah. We’re in 2018 dude.” - And racism is still a problem. Eurocentrism is still a problem. White Nationalism is still a problem. White fragility is absolutely a problem. 

“How much more do you want the deck stacked in the favor of specific racial classes?” - Interesting as true equality is the goal not giving special favors to specific racial classes. Equality seems like oppression when you’re accustomed to privilege. 

“Is it when white people are at the bottom? Is this all about retribution for the sins of the father? Do I need to cleanse myself at thine holy alter?” - Now your fragility has you resorting to attaining victimhood. As stated previously as well as implied throughout the thread, equality is the goal. True equality. 

Okay first of all what the hell is American Eurocentrism? That sounds mad up to me. Europe is the central focus of America? Do you mean Whitecentrism? Well it is a predominantly white country. Maybe that’s why everything around you seems so white. I doubt that’s the system and more or less just people existing.

Also, I’m still confused by this. What does white nationalism really mean to you? I’m a nationalist, which means economically speaking, I believe in putting my country first. And I’m white. Why is that a bad thing? Why does it make me instantly racist?

So what? We have black people talk about black things and white people talk about white things? I remember something like that happening in the 50s. I am absolutely free to comment on what I want. Maybe an outsider’s voice would give you a sense of perspective, and maybe loosen the grip this conspiracy has over you.

Keep calling me fragile, it’s a great way to convince me. ;)

Okay let’s just make something clear. At no point have I said racism isn’t racism. That’s idiotic. 

I’m saying that no matter what your fragility finds on SM, it can’t be used to justify your position, it’s flawed and circumstantial evidence. Please for the love of god understand that, I feel like I’m talking to a brick wall of fragility now. You’re basing your conception of the reality of all black people on what you find online coming out of a few dickheads in the bible belt. Which is about the most “comical” thing I can think of doing.

“Attaining victimhood” - maybe your fragility has actually been living in victimhood so long you can’t understand sarcasm ;) 

“Specific favours” - Great! Me too. Case closed. This is the egalitarian position.

“Accustomed to privilege” - No, I’m just curious as to what your fragility’s idea of true equality looks like.



Eurocentrism sounds made up to you? That’s quite indicative of ignorance. This is why its comical the lengths you are going to dictate what is or isn’t racism as well as your defensiveness to the subject. Considering America was colonized by Europeans via genocide and legislation to ensure that non-White Americans could not participate in a “democratic” society; Eurocentrism is a main theme that negatively effects POC. Systematic and institutionalized racism, unequal justice system that favors White males (luckily this is gradually improving), housing discrimination, etc. This is why it is amusing to see a White British male dictate what is or isn’t racism solely because he suffers from fragility to what was stated regarding the topic at hand. It doesn’t matter if the majority of the nation is White (which is also changing thankfully). There are non-White Americans who suffer at the hands of Eurocentrism in their very own country. America is not, was not, nor ever will be a White country. We are multicultural and this nation has historically been built by all races of people not just Whites. “Maybe that’s why everything around you seems so White.” - Jesus you really are reaching or perhaps you are just that ignorant. Maybe both.

You misused the word economically lmao. White nationalism isn’t putting your country first. As I stated America is NOT a White country. Never was nor ever will be. If White Nationalists want to live in a White country, they can kindly go back to Europe where the White countries are.

“So what? We have black people talk about blacks things and white people talk about white things? I remember something like this happening in the 50s. I am absolutely free to comment on what I want. Maybe an outsiders voice will give you a sense of perspective, and maybe loosen the grip the conspiracy has over you.” - There is nothing to learn from a White British male nationalist who gaslights the AMERICAN POC experience. In fact, you haven’t brought anything to the discussion except defensiveness, fragility, and gaslighting. You obviously have zero clue of the POC American experience nor the history of this nation. Perhaps all those characteristics are intertwined but nothing of value has been brought to the conversation. And nobody said you don’t have a right to comment lmao. 

You keep implying and gaslighting (like most White supremacists in America do). You have the right to be ignorant however but don’t get upset when people counter your attempts as gaslighting. It’s quite pathetic. 

“I’m saying that no matter what your fragility finds on SM, it can’t be used to justify your position, it’s flawed and circumstantial evidence. Please for the love of god understand that, I feel like I’m talking to a brick wall of fragility now. You’re basing your conception of the reality of all black people on what you find online coming out of a few dickheads in the bible belt. Which is about the most “comical” thing I can think of doing.” - Lol now you’re projecting. The only fragility here is coming from you considering how you’re dictating what is or isn’t racism (when there is clear evidence of it) and attempting to dictate how American society is when you aren’t even American. You’re literally just defensive to the topic at hand and inadvertently defending White supremacy in America with those far reaching excuses and attempts at justification. It has been stated that there is an ABUNDANCE of video evidence as well as countless witness throughout all the racist incidents. You just keep indirectly trying to defend the racists that have been caught based on your excessive attempts at justifying why they are probably not racist and making irrelevant inferences that make absolutely zero sense. That is a manifestation of your fragility lol.

“My conception of reality” is shared by over half of Americans and it is pure as night and day within our society. Anti-POC racism is nationwide and doesn’t have anything to do with “few dickheads in the Bible Belt.” How far do you have to reach to appease your own sensitive fragility? Lol

Oh now you’re resorting to the “sarcasm” excuse? Now that is pathetic. I see you keep projecting your own feelings onto me. That is precisely what white fragility does. It will make you resort to scraping all over in order to somehow portray yourself as a victim because of your inability to intellectually discuss societal issues within American society. 

“What your fragility’s idea of true equality is.” - Oh boy. Apparently you’re also unable to think critically considering the nature of this “discussion” (more like you just merely getting defensive and upset writing essays of bs based on your lack of knowledge of our society). r/4chan would be a great place for you regarding like-minded people. 




I’m not going to bother responding any more to someone with so much defensiveness, ill-will, and zealotry in them. It’s clear we won’t get anywhere. Have a great day. I hope you realise you sound just like Alex Jones.

“Defensiveness, ill-will, and zealotry in them.” - Great because you’re projecting again and are unable to have an intellectual discussion without your fragility getting the best of you. That will get you nowhere in life buddy. Your opinions are indicative of a White supremacist mixed with Alex Jones. Again another comment of projection. You are pathetic dude.

Yes the verdict being thrown out was a good thing, because the jury was inconsistent and so it allowed for a more accurate retrial. That would in turn give them more money for their son's death as well as harhser punishment for the cop. This really doesn't have anything to do with my history or account age.

He commented this on the Twitter snapshot about the black dentist killed by a cop, judge found the cop guilty, then Kavanaugh threw the verdict out.

Edit: More to the story, as there mostly is. The jury itself was inconsistent with it's ruling and deliberations, finding the cop innocent of murder while guilty of improper procedure and awarding damages to the Hundleys. Both parties in the case appealed, and Kavanaugh agreed that it needed a retrial. Wether or not the cop was found guilty or innocent is another matter, as I'm unable to find any follow up to the trial via news sources.

[deleted]

No, it was a civil case and they found *a jury* found that the cop didn't violate any rights, but was negligent in the initial stop. The FAMILY of the dentist appealed, because the jury had said they didn't believe the cop, and yet they basically sided with him. Kavanaugh agreed with the family and sent it back to trial.

The family basically had 3 claims in their lawsuit, first was assault and battery on the dentist, second was a violation of his civil rights, and third was negligence. The reason they included the third claim is that if the jury agreed with the police officer, that he shot the dentist, they could still find he was negligent for the initial stop. 

Yet the jury said they didn't believe the officers story of self defence, but still found that he wasn't liable on the first two claims. Kavanaugh (and the family) found that this didn't jive, because you'd have to believe the officer in order to find him not liable. 

But hey, I guess you think he should have allowed it to stand? To have ruled the officer was only negligent for pulling the dentist over, and not for murdering him. 

Why are you out here shilling false info all over this thread?

This but unironically

r/fragilejewishredditor

Despite there not being a retrial, Kavenough WANTED there to be a retrial. I guess you could say I was a dick but i wasn't passing it off as optimistic. I didn't explain much to the mods because what was there to be said? I didn't break a rule plain and simple, but instead of questioning me or looking back at the post again, they just said no.

Wow what a brave soldier you are 😂

You're right that Kavanaugh threw it out for good reason, but even the cops lawyers said it had to be redone because of the same reason. I'll admit I got suckered by this one, buy try to find any report of a follow up on the trial and not even a tweet about it coming up. If the jury was hung and redone, why didn't this get a follow up? I know the last two questions are tangential, but it helps get a clearer picture.

I just got through double-checking the story since someone brought up the civil suit of the Hundleys. I'm going through right now and correcting as I go, but there are no factual inaccuracies in what I said, only half the story. I'm working on it.

Thank you for demonstrating your willful ignorance.

How dafuq does that make it hate sub. Ducking moron

Imagine letting Jews fuck you up this badly.  Imagine how mentally weak you'd need to be.

You're not a failure, the Jewish conspiracy is why your life sucks. 

Basically ""I'm rubber, you're glue"" with /r/subredditsashashtags 

What a pathetic shitstain

It's called sensitivity. You were being an insensitive dick, and your post history tends to lean more towards either cold logic(which is rarely what people want when involving a dead loved one) or just snide sarcasm(which isn't helpful at all) so the mod probably muted you to keep it peaceful enough in case T_D showed up. Besides, the fact there wasn't a retrial means it was meaningless as the cop got off as if he'd been declared entirely innocent. 

No, it was a civil case and they found a jury found that the cop didn't violate any rights, but was negligent in the initial stop. The FAMILY of the dentist appealed, because the jury had said they didn't believe the cop, and yet they basically sided with him. Kavanaugh agreed with the family and sent it back to trial.

The family basically had 3 claims in their lawsuit, first was assault and battery on the dentist, second was a violation of his civil rights, and third was negligence. The reason they included the third claim is that if the jury agreed with the police officer, that he shot the dentist, they could still find he was negligent for the initial stop.

Yet the jury said they didn't believe the officers story of self defence, but still found that he wasn't liable on the first two claims. Kavanaugh (and the family) found that this didn't jive, because you'd have to believe the officer in order to find him not liable.

But hey, I guess you think he should have allowed it to stand? To have ruled the officer was only negligent for pulling the dentist over, and not for murdering him.

You guys love to project huh 

Edit: I’m a dumbass apparently 

“You’re a RAAAAAAYYCEEEEST!”

NPC #483726262627

I’m picturing what he/it physically looks like and I’m laughing 😂 

Here's the thing, neither the far right or left wing really likes logic, so as someone who likes to be in the middle, who is tired of all the bullshit nowadays with false information and people copy and pasting shit without research. That's what I do, I use logic, because that's the only tool that stays valid since no one wants to hear the other person's side and just wants to find dirt and make the other side angrier. These people don't care about this dentist, if they did then they would've done there fucking research, quite honestly I don't either. I don't know anything about him, but to start blaming people just to blame without even caring about the subject at hand isn't right.

You know I got this exact same response, word for word, from one other user. In fact he's the one that made me go on this little excursion. So I'll start ignoring you now if that's cool.

How am I the one projecting if I'm doing the actual digging into backgrounds and trying to figure out the context of said situation? 

Love how you call others NPCs as you regurgitate other unoriginal bullshit

Except that's not even close to what I said. Try again bucko.

Edit: by the way, every time you type like that here's the face you're making https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/9jm8b1/sure_about_that/?utm_source=reddit-android

Both sides are the same? Legitimately screw off.

I know, I’m using your copy and spam strat. 

Plunge my anus with your sweet little tongue 

Look here you ducking idiot. I’m not being willfully ignorant, you’re implying that being wrong somehow equates to being a hate sub. You’re making way too many assumptions. 

Edit: one my dumbest moments. I thought you were the other guy.

Sorry about that 

“Orange man bad!”

NPC response #737262

He’s on your side doofus. Work on your reading comprehension.

Edit: nvm I need to learn how to follow replies lol

Each side is the same thing. People who don't want to comprimise.

Yeah, yeah they are. This is doing some strawmanning for explanation purposes but here's an analogy.
Far left: All the guns in school shooting are legal, therefore ban most guns.
Far right: No, the guns are bought illegally meaning that we need to enforce laws better.
And that's where the arguement starts. Now here's a bunch of crompises that aren't going to fix the entire problem but will at least help that no one talks about.
1. Mental health checks before getting a gun.
2. Telling parents to put guns in more secure places or locking them so other kids won't find them.
3. A waiting period before getting a gun.

Reeeeeeeeessist!!!

No worries man, that exact thing happens to me a lot. Thank you for looking back, its becoming harder to find people who are able to admit they were wrong in the past. You are the reason I have hope for the world.

Wow so original and intelligent

I’m afraid you’re printing out the wrong string. Check for syntax errors.

Yeah, because compromising has gotten us so far with these people.

>We should just give Hitler anything he wants.  It's important to compromise.

Hey, between3and30charact, just a quick heads-up:  
**arguement** is actually spelled **argument**. You can remember it by **no e after the u**.  
Have a nice day!

^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment.

Again, fuck off with the rhetoric of ""both sides are the same"". One side is actively trying to get people registered to vote, the other is actively purging voters from the rolls to keep them from voting. You sound like a single issue voter, so I'm just going to end this conversation.

Way more unique than “Orange man bad”. That shit gets spammed by you guys all day. And in this context it doesn’t even make sense.

Excuse me who do you mean ""these people""?

Nice analogy there, because the entire right wing equals out the exact same as hitler. It's not like I already mentioned how there's a far left and far right that you can't really compromise with. Good on you though, here I'll do the same with your side ""We should just give Stalin anything he wants. It's important to compromise"". But wait whats that? Not everyone is like one person on their side and that's why we need to stop generalizing and talk to eachother instead of continuing to slander eachother?

Hey CommonMisspellingBot, just a quick heads up:  
Your spelling hints are really shitty because they're all essentially ""remember the fucking spelling of the fucking word"".

You're useless.

Have a nice day!

I'm a leftist, learn how to read reddit comment sections

https://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/comments/9pkcam/radio_ad_in_arkansas_suggests_lynching_if/?utm_source=reddit-android 

one example, yes. Idicitative of the whole, not entirely. This combined with the callousness of our current president towards multiple different events has snowballed and will continue until either he is investigated for everything, or he continues to embolden those that will use his attitudes as an excuse to be as hateful as they want. You want me to compromise with these people, show me that they want to compromise with me in good faith. Until then, your rhetoric is just divisive and only adds to the confusion.

Edit: your wording leads me to assume you associate with them. I assumed you weren't going to be trying to group yourself in with the guys that actually wants everything that Trump has been doing so far but who's to say.

Edit2: remember how I said his callousness would snowball? https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/9pkw38/eric_trump_complains_about_lefts_lack_of_civility/?utm_source=reddit-android

Oh man the FAR RIGHT did a strang and outlandish thing? Well it's not like there's people on the right not like that, everyone keeps the same company always. Speaking of which the left are ALLLLLL MURDERERS.

You, are dissillusioned and need to remember that the right wing is not all people being greedy or racist and that they are just another group trying to make America better with a different bunch of viewpoints.

How about you reread what I said about not everyone being the way that I used as an example, then come back and try and talk to me like I'm not a moron that doesn't get that the minority doesn't define the majority. You want to talk about the bad on both sides? The left can be spineless, overly courteous when they needed to show acctual backbone, and were just as willing to shill out in the 90's as the right was at the time. The right is over zealous in their ideals and believes it's way is the true way the world works, even though the only reason it's like that is because they made and selectively enforced those rules to begin with. Am I disillusioned with how American politics works right now, yes. Do I know not all conservatives are like that? Duh, it's true if every group. You decide you want to actually talk about how fucked the system actually is instead of push the bullshit of ""both sides are the same"" narrative, you know where to find me.

It's not the far right.  It's the mainstream right.  Also, I don't think ""dissillusioned"" means what you think it means.  Maybe it would be logical to read a book every once in a while.

If it was the main stream right then the entirety of the far right would be made up of murderers and we know that's not true. The left and right are simply different political beliefs, the far left and far right are the extremes of both sides no more no less.
